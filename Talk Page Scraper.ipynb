Not only was the original content not speaking of any religious view, it was simply stating that it is common in the Muslim world for men to marry their nieces and cousins and that it endangers the health of future generations. Health with regard to incest is [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Incest&oldid=793863930#Inbreeding already covered in the article], with better/more appropriate sources.

There were no comments made on either my talk page or the article talk page, so all I have to go on re what the issue with the change was the inline comment re the update.  The basic change to the article I am proposing is to note that when incest occurs between an adolescent son and a mother, it is sometimes the son is the abuser.  This may be a disturbing conclusion, as are all conclusions in this topic.  But it is supported in the literature, which is why I posted it.  The primary reference (Courtois) does in fact have an online preview available, contrary to what is stated in the inline comment.  That reference is available for preview at [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0393313565] .  Look at pages 71-72 for this particular topic.  The secondary reference (Ward) is referred to by Courtois but may not have an online preview available.  Is it necessary that all references be available for free online?  There are certainly reliable sources that don\\'t make all their content available for free.  But in this case material supporting the statement I made IS available in an online preview.  Also it isn\\'t clear what the \\\\\"variables\\\\\" are that are unclear although based on another article that [[User:Legitimus]] reverted, this may refer to the age of the son.  I will try to find out the exact age of the sons referred to in this study, and also wait for a response to this message.  But absent a reason not to reinstate this edit, I will reinstate it in a few days after allowing time for a discussion.  I will focus primarily on this article, not the other article that was reverted, as I see this article as the primary focus of the change.  [[User:Dash77|Dash77]] ([[User talk:Dash77|talk]]) 17:07, 27 November 2017 (UTC)\\\\n:I made a judgement call on the revert.  There is no need to act so offended by it.  Remember, reverting is not a final decision.  The combination of the claim being rather extraordinary and the text not explaining the issue completely suggested this might need some discussion first before including it.\\\\n:Regarding the sources, no it is not necessary for them to all be online, but this sensitive topic and the unusual claim necessitated there has to be some kind of way of verifying it.  When I clicked through wikipedia\\'s link to google books, it came up empty for both books.  Your link solved only partially that problem.\\\\n:On the topic itself, there were things not made clear in the edit that are important.  First is whether violence (or the threat of, explicit or implied) or impairment were involved.  If the conscious mother went along with what happened without there being any threat or power imbalance against her, it sounds awfully suspect.  Second is the age of the male.  Obviously if the son is pre-pubescent, it casts serious doubt as to him being the \\\\\"abuser\\\\\" if the encounter is non-violent.  After all, pedophiles since the time they were first studied have made false or even [[Delusion|delusional]] claims of the child being the seducer.  Courtois states that the source \\\\\"Arroyo, Eth, and Pynoos 1984\\\\\" claim a case of an 8 year old, but also use the term \\\\\"sexual assault,\\\\\" implying there was some kind of aggression.  Page 72 of Courtois will not load for me so I can\\'t make further commentary.  But these matters need to be made clear in the text.[[User:Legitimus|Legitimus]] ([[User talk:Legitimus|talk]]) 18:59, 27 November 2017 (UTC)\\\\n:: I\\'m also skeptical of the claim involving the 8 year old.  Since it looks like you were able to access page 71, I\\'m referring to the \\\\\"adolescents\\\\\" mentioned in the previous sentence.  In other words I\\'m referring here to boys young enough to still legally be minors, but old enough to clearly be physically capable of initiating an attack.  Not 8 year olds.  But I would like to nail down the exact age we are talking about here.  I need to review the full original references which I haven\\'t had a chance to do yet.[[User:Dash77|Dash77]] ([[User talk:Dash77|talk]]) 19:57, 27 November 2017 (UTC)\\\\n:::OK, I got page 72 to load and have a better picture now of the topic.  The reference to Ward seems to finally spell it out:  They\\'re talking about *rape* by sons.  To explain, there is a subtle implication in the term \\\\\"incest\\\\\" that implies the encounter is non-violent or even consensual (i.e. between adults), but still \\\\\"wrong.\\\\\"  When violence enters the equation, it\\'s rape/abuse, and the fact that it also happens to be incestuous is simply an aggravating factor.  This is probably why terms like \\\\\"son-initiated incest\\\\\" sound so strange.  A footnote on Page 236 referencing Ward supports this, claiming calling it incest \\\\\"minimizes the reality of the violation.\\\\\"  [[User:Legitimus|Legitimus]] ([[User talk:Legitimus|talk]]) 20:42, 27 November 2017 (UTC)\\\\n::::Based on the quote above from page 236, she seems to be arguing that what is generally described as father-daughter incest would be more accurately called rape.  After all, the title of her book is \\\\\"Father Daughter Rape\\\\\".  As such, she seems to be mainly focused on the father-daughter situation, but seems to touch on other forms of intrafamilial sexual violence as well, including the mother-son situation.  I want to be sure I\\'m representing her views correctly before quoting her again.[[User:Dash77|Dash77]] ([[User talk:Dash77|talk]]) 07:20, 28 November 2017 (UTC)\\\\n:::::I support Legitimus\\'s revert of you here and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Child_sexual_abuse&diff=prev&oldid=812307706 at the Child sexual abuse] article. Good to see you discussing this instead of simply reverting. Also good to see Legitimus working the matter out via looking over sources. [[User:Flyer22 Reborn|Flyer22 Reborn]] ([[User talk:Flyer22 Reborn|talk]]) 03:39, 29 November 2017 (UTC)\\\\n::::::[[User:Flyer22 Reborn]]  I appreciate that and am currently working to research both references thoroughly before reinstating content.  At the same time there is clearly content in both references relevant to this article so I expect to reinstate some content-not necessarily exactly matching my original edit-once I\\'ve completed my review of the references.  [[User:Legitimus]] appears to have acted partly on the basis of the difficulty of accessing my references for free online and that doesn\\'t seem entirely consistent with [[WP:V|Wikipedia verifiability]] guidelines.  But will wait until I thoroughly review both references before I make further edits.[[User:Dash77|Dash77]] ([[User talk:Dash77|talk]]) 04:34, 29 November 2017 (UTC)\\\\n:::::::I hope you propose the text here first before making the changes to this article or the Child sexual abuse article. Also, per [[WP:Lead]], keep in mind that the lead is meant for summarizing the article. It is not meant for significant detail not first covered lower in the article. \\\\n\\\\n:::::::On a side note: There is no need to [[WP:Ping]] me to either article since they are both on my watchlist. [[User:Flyer22 Reborn|Flyer22 Reborn]] ([[User talk:Flyer22 Reborn|talk]]) 04:38, 29 November 2017 (UTC)\\\\n\\\\n:::::::: Flyer22, I am bending over backwards to act in good faith here.  But there is no precedent either on this talk page or Wikipedia in general to back up your request that I first seek approval of my edits on this talk page.  That is a highly unusual request.  I will do everything I can to act in good faith here but will not be seeking preapproval of my edits on this talk page unless you can point me to a clear Wikipedia policy obligating me to do so.  I also don\\'t understand your comment re the lead.  I didn\\'t edit the lead in either article.  Willing to act in good faith but you are asking more than is reasonable.[[User:Dash77|Dash77]] ([[User talk:Dash77|talk]]) 05:08, 29 November 2017 (UTC)\\\\n\\\\n:::::::::It is not a highly unusual request. Do read [[WP:Consensus]] and [[WP:Bold, revert, discuss]]. Your edit was contested. It has now been contested by two editors. The information you are wanting to add is contentious. Legitimus has already identified problems with what you added. Any further text on this matter should have consensus on this talk page first. Or do you want to get it wrong again and end up being reverted again on the matter? [[User:Flyer22 Reborn|Flyer22 Reborn]] ([[User talk:Flyer22 Reborn|talk]]) 06:10, 29 November 2017 (UTC)\\\\n\\\\n:::::::::: Both Wikipedia links you mention say that one should attempt to address all editors\\' concerns.  But neither you nor Legitimus have explained what your concerns are.  You don\\'t like what I said but haven\\'t explained why.  At most Legitimus said he/she couldn\\'t access the references I provided for free online.  I already explained per [[WP:V|Wikipedia verifiability]] that isn\\'t a valid reason for rejecting my edits.  By no means am I admitting to getting it wrong.  Quite the contrary:  I am 99% percent sure I got it right.  But I am currently doing the legwork to be sure that I am 100% percent sure before reinstating any edits.  You say you are contesting my edits.  What exactly is your problem with my edits?  If you won\\'t say how can we hope to achieve consensus?[[User:Dash77|Dash77]] ([[User talk:Dash77|talk]]) 06:41, 29 November 2017 (UTC)\\\\n\\\\n:::::::::::Legitmus did explain. His \\\\\"20:42, 27 November 2017 (UTC)\\\\\" post is one example. And I agree with him. [[User:Flyer22 Reborn|Flyer22 Reborn]] ([[User talk:Flyer22 Reborn|talk]]) 06:49, 29 November 2017 (UTC)\\\\n\\\\n:::::::::::: Legitimus reverted first and didn\\'t explain until much, much later.  Not the right order to do things in.  Nevertheless it is definitely my intention in good faith to incorporate Legitimus\\' comments of 11/27 20:42 into any new edits I make to this article.  I certainly have an obligation to do that and I believe I already responded in a positive way to Legitimus comments of 11/27 20:42.  I would ask you, with respect, to assume until proven otherwise I will address Legitimus\\' concerns in good faith when I edit this article again.  I have been a Wikipedian for 12 years and have some familiarity with how things are done around here.  When I edit this article again, do you personally have any concerns you want me to address beyond Legitimus\\' comments of 11/27 20:42?[[User:Dash77|Dash77]] ([[User talk:Dash77|talk]]) 07:15, 29 November 2017 (UTC)\\\\n:::::::::::: Legitimus\\' comments of 11/27 20:42 referenced \\\\\"rape by the son\\\\\".  But so did my original edit to this article.  It is an extremely uncomfortable topic.  But I\\'m not clear where you think I \\\\\"got it wrong\\\\\"?[[User:Dash77|Dash77]] ([[User talk:Dash77|talk]]) 07:52, 29 November 2017 (UTC)\\\\n:To lay out my concerns in detail, the first sentence of the edit was: \\\\\"While incest between adults and children is generally seen as child abuse, there are cases where mother-son incest is initiated by an adolescent son who is the abuser.\\\\\"\\\\n:That way that is stated is what I see as problematic.  As I said above, the word choice fixates on the matter of it being incest between an adult and a child, missing or failing to emphasize the fact that this is a actually referring to the violent rape of an adult by an nearly-adult.  It comes down to the point you\\'re trying to make.  Parent-child incest usually involves non-violent psychological manipulation and an unequal power dynamic of parent and child.  In this way, these two types of incident are completely different, with the only similarity being consanguinity.  As an alternative, how about the following:\\\\n:\\\\\"While incest between adults and children generally involves the adult as the perpetrator of abuse, there are rare instances of sons sexually assaulting their mothers.  These sons are typically mid to late adolescent and unlike parent-initiated incest, the incidents involve some kind of physical force.  Although the mothers may be accused of being seductive with their sons and inviting the sexual contact, despite strong contrary evidence. Such accusations can parallel other forms of rape, where due to [[victim blaming]] a woman is accused of somehow being at fault for the rape. In some cases mother-son incest is best classified as [[acquaintance rape]] of the mother by the adolescent son.\\\\\"\\\\n:[[User:Legitimus|Legitimus]] ([[User talk:Legitimus|talk]]) 13:48, 29 November 2017 (UTC)\\\\n::Sorry it has taken me a few days to respond, and thank you for proposing a constructive change to my proposed edit.  As I mentioned a couple of times, with concerns having been raised I wanted to take the time to fully review the originals of both references I cited.  Now that I\\'ve done so, I think I\\'m mostly fine with the change you propose, although I would make one small modification.  I would say \\\\\"mid adolescent to young adult\\\\\" rather than \\\\\"mid to late adolescent\\\\\" as both Ward and Courtois, in referring to the relatively rare known cases, clearly note some cases involving young adult rather than adolescent sons.  I will give it a few more days to see if others respond and then make the changes you suggest with my \\\\\"young adult\\\\\" modification.[[User:Dash77|Dash77]] ([[User talk:Dash77|talk]]) 19:37, 2 December 2017 (UTC)\\\\n:::I\\'m ok with that, though will also wait for other commentary.[[User:Legitimus|Legitimus]] ([[User talk:Legitimus|talk]]) 02:32, 3 December 2017 (UTC)\\\\n::::Page updated as discussed above since there didn\\'t seem to be any further input.[[User:Dash77|Dash77]] ([[User talk:Dash77|talk]]) 05:20, 7 December 2017 (UTC)\\\\n:::::[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Incest&diff=814238587&oldid=814237494 Tweaked].
