No one has ever claimed Kid Gleason (the White Sox manager) was in on the conspiracy. The first two sentences of this entry read like someone's private goof. Chick Gandil, the first baseman of the White Sox and not the manager, is widely believed to have engineered the conspiracy on the players' side.\\n\\n[[User:207.237.215.155]] asked this in the Black Sox section: \\\"does anyone have proof of this? sounds like urban legen\\nd to me\\\". [[User:Stephen Compall|Stephen Compall]] 15:04, 20 May 2005 (UTC)\\n\\nIf what you are asking about is where the term 'Black Sox' comes from, the truth and the myth are quite intermixed at this point.  Comiskey was certainly known as very tight man about money, and regularly he would do anything in his power to short his players.  The most well known incident of this is when Chicotte, the Sox's ace, was benched (under Comiskey's orders)in 1919 for the final two plus weeks of the season to prevent him from reaching 30 wins which would have kicked in a $10,000 bonus - he ended the season with 29 wins and a $6,000 base salary. The stories of Comiskey forcing his players to pay for their own laundry expenses are true (he commonly forced players to pay many expenses out of their own pockets while on the road), but the 'Black Sox' title does not (as far as I know of) appear until after the 1919 series when Chicago reporters (namely those of the Chicago Herald) began to dig up dirt on the scandal (no pun intended).\\n\\nThis should be merged into the 1919 World Series article, as it doesn't seem to serve an independent purpose. It doesn't explain any of the reasons why the Chicago team had been considered cursed. [[User:160.227.21.41|160.227.21.41]] 01:05, 28 October 2005 (UTC)\\n\\nFair enough.  I'll change the page I created into a redirect ASAP.[[User:Amchow78|Amchow78]] 20:06, 28 October 2005 (UTC)\\n\\nSome years ago I read an article (I forget where) about the scandal by someone who studied contemporary newspaper accounts of the games and came to the conclusion that BOTH teams were trying to throw the Series (presumably on behalf of two different parties), but the White Sox simply were more successful at it.[[User:Alloco1|Alloco1]] 22:18, 19 March 2006 (UTC)\\n\\nIf you read \\\"The Glory of Their Times\\\" by Lawrence Ritter, the account given by Ed Roush, the star centerfielder for the Reds, states that in fact some members of the Reds were approached by gamblers to have them throw some games (including Game 3, which they won).  It is a very interesting account, since I had never read anything regarding a possible fix involving players on the Cincinnati Reds team.  But Ed Roush's account, while short, is very detailed and believeable.  By the way, I highly recommend reading not only the section on Ed Roush, but the whole book; any true fan of the game will find it an extremely pleasurable read - T.J. Swartz\\n\\n== date of start of curse ==\\n\\nI reverted the change of the start of the curse from 1917 back to 1919.  The \\nidea as I've always understood it is that if it hadn't been for the sellout, they ''would'' have won in 1919.  Thus the curse starts at the moment the deal was struck.  They were not cursed in 1918, they just weren't good enough to win the pennant.  If you must revert, go ahead--it's hardly a big deal.  [[User:Chick Bowen|Chick Bowen]] 00:40, 3 November 2005 (UTC)\\n\\nI see your point.  As fair as it is, I used the \\\"Curse of the Bambino\\\" page as a guide for creating the timeline of the Black Sox curse.  In that page, they've put the start of the curse in 1918 ... despite the fact that Babe Ruth was sold to the Yankees in 1920 ... two years after the Red Sox last won the World Series with him. Similarily, I tried following that guideline when I started the date of the Black Sox curse.  I'll leave it @ 1919 for now ... and pose this question on the \\\"Curse of the Bambino\\\" discussion page if it hasn't been posed already. [[User:Amchow78|Amchow78]] 03:41, 10 November 2005 (UTC)\\n\\nAfter posing the question on the \\\"Curse of the Bambino\\\" discussion page, they've changed the start date of their curse from 1918 to 1920.  With that as a precedent setter, it looks like 1919 will stick as the year that the Curse of the Black Sox started. [[User:Amchow78|Amchow78]] 01:24, 11 November 2005 (UTC)\\n\\nIt should be noted, however, that the White Sox won 88 games in 1919, the Reds 95, a seven-game difference.  Also that [[Edd Roush]], the Reds' Hall-of-Fame right fielder and (I think) the last surviving player from this Series on either side, swore until his death in [[1988]] that the Reds would still have won the Series had the whole thing been on the level.  That could have just been pride in his team, but he was the last man involved who had some understanding of what was really going on -- on the field, anyway.  -- Pacholeknbnj, 2:00 PM EST, January 28, 2006\\n\\nWho is Mike Jones?

Chick Gandil, the first baseman of the White Sox and not the manager, is widely believed to have engineered the conspiracy on the players' side.\\n\\n------------------\\n\\nI deleted the curse section.  No Sox fan talked about a curse.  Even the Chicago media never acknowledged a curse.  Sox fans never believed in one.  We just believed that we had crappy management.  Curses are excuses for idiots like Red Sox and Cub fans.\\n\\nI think the curse section should be left in, and I've restored it. I'm sure very few people truly believe there's some sort of curse affecting the White Sox, Red Sox, or Cubs, but such stories and superstitions are part of baseball and deserve a mention. Just because there's no actual curse doesn't mean there's no Curse story. [[User:PaulGS|PaulGS]] 18:53, 30 June 2006 (UTC)\\n\\n== End of the Black Sox? ==\\nWhat about a section detailing the 2005 World Series, and the presumed end of the \\\"curse?\\\" [[User:Realbrvhrt|Realbrvhrt]] 20:31, 6 June 2006 (UTC)\\n:Well, it's covered now -[[User:Elmer Clark|Elmer Clark]] 06:32, 18 August 2006 (UTC)\\n\\n==The Curse==\\nWhat exactly is the basis for having a section on the \\\"curse\\\".

It's something hardly anyone takes seriously, but baseball, more so than other sports, is about its history, and the supposed curse is part of that.

[[User:Vidor|Vidor]] 09:01, 16 November 2006 (UTC)\\n\\n:I disagree wholeheartedly.  The Scandal and the series are not one in the same.  The article about the [[1919 World Series]] is to communicate the events of the series.  The article about the [[Black Sox Scandal]] is to communicate the events and experiences surrounding the series.  While there is some over lap, these are two separate issues. Similarly, there is an article for [[The Catch]] and another article for the [[1954 World Series]]. // [[User:Tecmobowl|Tecmobowl]] 09:34, 16 November 2006 (UTC)\\n\\n*'''Strongly oppose''': [[User:Tecmobowl|Tecmobowl]] is absolutely correct. In addition to what he said above, thre is a whole series of articles on {year} World Series. If this page were merged into the Black Sox Scandal page, should the template that connects all of the World Series pages be changed for this one series? Should the 1998 Series page be merged into the earthquake page (I think that was the year, wasn't it?)? --[[User:Ohms law|Ohms law]] 17:08, 17 November 2006 (UTC)\\n\\n*'''Oppose''', per Tecmobowl.  And it's [[1989 World Series|1989]] :P . [[User:Jpers36|Jpers36]] 17:44, 17 November 2006 (UTC)\\n\\n::Y'all are nuts.  First, the articles should be merged under THIS article, the article for the 1919 World Series.  I am not proposing removing this article from the list of World Series articles; that would be silly.  (Removed the \\\"merge\\\" recommendation from this article, to reflect that.) The scandal and the Series are the same; the scandal was about fixing the Series, the scandal as executed was the fix of the Series, and the aftermath of the scandal was the aftermath of the Series.  I entered \\\"1919 World Series\\\" into the search engine the other day, and was amazed to see very little about the fix--just a dry list of box scores, essentially.  [[User:Vidor|Vidor]] 19:02, 17 November 2006 (UTC)\\n\\n::Please review [[WP:NPA]] before making any comments on the topic at hand. // [[User:Tecmobowl|Tecmobowl]] 01:06, 18 November 2006 (UTC)\\n\\n::*Well, that makes more sense. The confusion comes from how you listed the merge request. There is a way to say \\\"another page should be merged to this one\\\", like this: {{tlp|mergefrom|SOURCE PAGE}} would be placed on this page, and {{tlp|mergeto|DESTINATION PAGE}} would be placed on the other page (Black Sox scandal, in this instance). I still think it's a bad idea though. Each topic is distinct in it's own right. There should be a short sub-section here with a paragraph about the Black Sox scandal, and a link to the full article, though. --[[User:Ohms law|Ohms law]] 08:21, 18 November 2006 (UTC)\\n\\n:*'''Tecmo Banned Indefinitely.'''

Sorry!  My personal preference would be to reserve the top of the article for information about to the specific world series.  I would think an infobox about the series itself, or some imagery relating to the series would be the best thing to put up in the introduction area.  If you feel strongly that the template should be placed at he top, please feel free to put it back. // [[User:Tecmobowl|Tecmobowl]] 08:39, 18 November 2006 (UTC)\\n:*Well, I agree about the top ought to be being used for info specific to the series. The infobox does go along the side though, so that the top and right should still be available for imagry. Infobox's tend to be pretty cooperative, from what i've seen elsewhere. Anyway, i'll go ahead and put it back. Just didn't want to start any sort of \\\"edit war\\\", you know? --[[User:Ohms law|Ohms law]] 09:10, 18 November 2006 (UTC)\\n:*Right now there is no alternative template so i can't really complain.

If you or anyone else knows anything about CSS, I was attempint to copy the system used on the {{tl|MLBAllStarGame}} template so that the infobox could be hidden.

It's not to be a dictionary, but a building block for the article:\\n  '''ADVENTISTS''' [Adventists] [advent, Lat.,=coming], Generally speaking, Adventist(s) are members of a group of \\n  religiously related denominations whose distinctive doctrine is centered around their belief in the imminent \\n  second coming of Jesus Christ. {{user0|Maniwar}} 01:55, 14 October 2006 (UTC)\\n\\n== Not a disambig ==\\nThis really shouldn't be a disambig page; there seems to be a need for a (possibly short) substantive article that outlines what all the Adventist denominations have in common, including their common history and development, along with links to more detailed articles about particular denominations.  Currently that type of article either doesn't exist, or isn't clearly linked from here.  --[[User:R'n'B|Russ]] [[User talk:R'n'B|(talk)]] 15:38, 14 January 2007 (UTC)\\n:Agreed. Although there seem to be many kinds of Adventists, they all seem to be related. [[User:Ewlyahoocom|Ewlyahoocom]] 07:09, 31 January 2007 (UTC)\\n\\n::I agree. I would like to see a section on theology. I imagine that most Adventist groups see themselves or saw themselves as the true church. Most probably emphasize the law more than other popular (but not necessarily all scholarly) Christian beliefs. A good number keep the Sabbath. Probably all or most have been considered either a cult or as sect by more mainstream groups either presently or at least in the past. Perhaps many of them believe in conditional immortality/annihilationism and an unconscious state of the dead (the SDAs do at least). I'm not an expert, so someone please do proper research before writing such a section. I have a good understanding of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, but not much about the other groups.

However Adventist is a wider term and many denominations could fall under this term, however to be Adventist ones focused of the church is on eschatological or the end time events, second coming of Jesus Christ.  JW Jehovah Witness may be considered Adventist but they have a very different view of the last day events than Seventh-day Adventist.  World Wide Church of Christ has more historical connection with Adventist. It would be interesting to build a chart that compares theology of Adventist. The other distinct doctrine of Seventh-day Adventist is its view on the sanctuary which is actually the central theological point from which all other Seventh-day Adventist beliefs emerge. This would include the Sabbath doctrine. Another comparison is the many Sabbatarian denominations that exist not all are Adventist and many worship diffrently.  <small><span class=\\\"autosigned\\\">\\u2014Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Michael paul paolini|Michael paul paolini]] ([[User talk:Michael paul paolini|talk]] \\u2022 [[Special:Contributions/Michael paul paolini|contribs]]) 07:15, 10 December 2008 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->\\n\\n== Creation Seventh Day Adventist Church ==\\n\\nI removed the [[Creation Seventh Day Adventist Church]] section, due to [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view#Undue weight|undue weight]].

[[User:Colin MacLaurin|Colin MacLaurin]] ([[User talk:Colin MacLaurin|talk]]) 11:58, 14 July 2009 (UTC)\\n\\n== Denominational ordering ==\\n\\nI have changed the ordering of the the denominations listed on the article by the dates they are created. This means that the Advent Christian Church is first (founded in 1860), Seventh Day Adventist are second (founded in 1863) and Church of God General Conference (founded in 1921?). I believe that this is the most neutral way to order these denominations in the article based on verifiable information. --'''[[User:TheFarix|Farix]]''' ([[User talk:TheFarix|Talk]]) 23:34, 19 July 2009 (UTC)\\n\\n:I see that the denominational order has been changed again. Can anyone give a reason why? --'''[[User:TheFarix|Farix]]''' ([[User talk:TheFarix|Talk]]) 22:48, 15 August 2009 (UTC)\\n\\n::They were ordered according to over all historical significance. Some were organized earlier than others, but they have had relatively little impact on the world. Some have disappeared. Some have merged with others. Some still exist in small pockets here and there. The larger and more well known are listed before the lesser known ones. This is not meant to be demeaning. It stands to reason that the larger ministries are somehow making a greater impact and are likely to be seen as more significant. Trabucogold (talk) 23:10, 15 August 2009 (UTC)\\n\\n:::(edit conflict with ealier replay) How do you objectively determine historical significance? Assuming that larger means more significant seems to be rather POV. Founding order is the most most neutral manner of ordering the denominations. Next to that would be alphabetic order. --'''[[User:TheFarix|Farix]]''' ([[User talk:TheFarix|Talk]]) 23:15, 15 August 2009 (UTC)\\n\\n::::I just described what is objectively historical significance.  No need to go over it again.  Before, the ordering was extremely confusing without obvious connection between related organizations.  I'll go with as is for now, although, success and historical significance of the organizations is easily measured by membership.  [[User:Trabucogold|Trabucogold]] ([[User talk:Trabucogold|talk]]) 23:44, 15 August 2009 (UTC)\\n\\n:::::I have to completely disagree that membership size is any indicator of historical significance. A denomination can have a great deal of historical significance, but have a relativity small membership today. You simply can't judge historical significance on today's numbers. Significance implies influence, and influence is nearly impossible to objectively measure in a [[WP:NPOV|neutral manner]], much else actually [[WP:V|verify]]. That's why founding dates is a much better way to sort the denominations. There are [[WP:NOR|no interpretations]] regarding significance, it's easily verifiable, and no one can argue that the order reflects some sort of point of view. --'''[[User:TheFarix|Farix]]''' ([[User talk:TheFarix|Talk]]) 00:00, 16 August 2009 (UTC)\\n\\nBoth TheFarix and Trabucogold make valuable contributions, thank-you. As for the prominence of various groups, that will be determined by what the leading independent reliable sources say are the most prominent. As for membership, of course this is a key determinant, and will usually rank prominence, but not always. For instance [[Jewish population]] is less than [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] membership, yet the former is far more prominent. [[User:Colin MacLaurin|Colin MacLaurin]] ([[User talk:Colin MacLaurin|talk]]) 02:40, 19 August 2009 (UTC)\\n\\n: What about the connections the Adventists such as SDAs have with [[Mormonism]], [[Christian Scientists]], [[Pentecostals]] and [[Seventh Day Baptists]]? They have some similar practices, beliefs and observances among each other, including the SDAs' avoidance of drugs, stimulants or other things (the SDAs are [[vegetarians]]) in order for one to maintain good health? + [[Special:Contributions/71.102.7.77|71.102.7.77]] ([[User talk:71.102.7.77|talk]]) 00:24, 27 December 2009 (UTC)\\n::Other than the Sabbath connection with the Seventh-day Baptists, all the other similarities are purely superficial.  A S-d Baptist woman introduced the Sabbath to early Adventists.  But the Mormons, Christian Scientists and Pentecostals have had no direct connection with the SDA church.  Much of these ideas came from the Temperance Movement which was nondenominational. [[User:Trabucogold|Trabucogold]] ([[User talk:Trabucogold|talk]]) 17:41, 28 December 2009 (UTC)\\n:::Trabucogold's answer is solid. Another parallel which is sometimes drawn is that Adventists, Christian Scientists, Mormons, and Jehovah's Witnesses all developed at a similar time, and all had leaders claiming to be prophets. All have been considered fringe Christian movements, or in the case of Adventism, semi-fringe (e.g. [[Martin E. Marty]]'s assessment). Yet as for health practices above, these similarities come from their emergence in a similar cultural milieu, not from interaction between the bodies. For instance, a lay person suggested Ellen White may have incorporated some of Joseph Smith's teachings, but scholars have rejected this claim, arguing instead that similarities arise from being in a similar culture. [[User:Colin MacLaurin|Colin MacLaurin]] ([[User talk:Colin MacLaurin|talk]]) 01:25, 7 January 2010 (UTC)\\n\\n::::Yes, except I agree with Farix that it is more proper if the denominations are listed chronologically after their formal foundation.

I remember seeing him, myself, one night, on the bill with Yakov Smirnoff, a walk-on from Rich Hall, and the only guy to get any real laughs that night, the closer, the screamer, Sam Kinnison. Hall was grindingly boring. Smirnoff got a few giggles about how it was 'in Russia'. And ADC got barely even that. I personally didn't get his act, at the time. I wasn't laughing, either.

Recenlty, because of the dead end of the [[Scientific method]], scientists like Hawking concluded that the laws of physics are not actually space-time position independant but space-time position bounded, thats why they created the black holes concept and claimed that space or time is absent inside them. The information paradox of black holes is, for some anti-scientists philosophers, the proof that space is not homogeneous and/or that the laws of physics are actually space-time position dependant and not space-time position bounded, as long as, according to the paradox, information seems to vanish or (alternatively) stored to unconventional material (or non-material) objects. Apart from the black hole information paradox, some experiments came also close to the philosophy of the position dependancy of the laws of physics. Some universal constants used in well known equations have been found to change their values (increase or decrease) when measured in small fragments of time or when time passing [http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~mim/res.html]. A group of pioneer \\\"scientists\\\", lead by John K. Webb [http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/STAFF/ACADEMIC/webb.html], continues the experiments in this revolutionary field.''\\n\\nThis mostly reads like pseudoscience.

Iron Condor, I wish to point out that this whole article is about the supposed black hole information loss paradox, so if you think information loss isn't paradoxical you ought to be seeking to delete the whole article, not one little part of it. That's unlikely to happen, though, because you have powerful enemies, like Stephen Hawking.\\n\\n:::I think the problem is indeed conflicting meanings of the word \\\"information\\\". When the people who talk about this kind of thing say that information is not lost, what they mean is that different initial states evolve into different final states. That's a property of Lagrangian/Hamiltonian evolution both classically and quantum mechanically. If you melt an ice cube in a universe governed by a Lagrangian, the final state differs depending on what message was written on the ice cube, and in that sense the message is not lost. It's diffused into the environment to such an extent that you (a creature in that universe) could never hope to recover it, but it's still ''there'', at least as far as the mathematical model is concerned. Black hole evaporation, in the sort of semiclassical model that Hawking like to work with, violates that principle. You squeeze an ice cube until it becomes a black hole, then wait for it to evaporate. You've converted the ice cube into thermal noise, but, in contrast to ordinary melting, the fluctuations in the noise do not encode the initial state of the ice cube. The particles that make up the ice cube literally cease to exist at the singularity, and after that you can't run the evolution operator backwards to find out what they were.\\n\\n:::That's the idea.

Every time an atom absorbs a photon, the information that the photon existed, where it came from and what energy it had are all destroyed. No examination of the atom in question can ever reveal it, because it is not contained in the universe any more. Complete knowledge of the full wavefunction of everything will not tell you that this atom was hit by a photon of that energy from such a direction this long ago. Because information has been destroyed -- as it is destroyed routinely all the time.\\n\\n::::In science, it is not acceptable to make up things because they seem plausible to you and then proclaim that they're true. If QM teaches us anything about information, then it is that the universe is substantially *noise* at the bottom. This may seem counter-intuitive to people like yourself who have never actually thought about reality, but that's what you find if you are willing to sit down and study the actual, real, honest physics of the universe in which we live.\\n\\n::::In science it is *also* unacceptable to try to resolve a dispute by invoking an assumed authority.

But there is actually some subtlety here, even in purely classical models, which is worth looking into in rather more detail. (See also for example discussion of topics like the [[H theorem]] and/or [[Loschmidt's paradox]] in standard books on statistical mechanics - eg the classic work by Tolman - or standard works on the philosophy of thermal physics).\\n\\n:::::The issue - even with conventional entropy increase - is that we correctly predict entropy increase, even though at a microscopic level we tend to assume the dynamics are deterministic, reversible, and (in the classical case) [[Liouville's theorem|Liouvillian]], or equivalently (in the quantum case) [[unitarity (physics)|unitary]].  In loose terms this means information is ''not'' lost -- at least ''not by the dynamics''.  Unitarity of this kind is one of the basic assumptions made in constructing quantum mechanics.\\n\\n:::::But if information isn't being destroyed ''by the dynamics'', how is the entropy increasing, in situations like eg two gases being allowed to mix?  The answer, put forward at least as far back as [[J. Willard Gibbs|Gibbs]] is ''coarse graining''.  It is ''us'', as analysts, who throw the information away, not the dynamics.  So for example, in thermodynamics, by insisting on a description of the system only in terms of its current macroscopic thermdynamic variables -- with no room for taking account of detailed microscopic correlations -- we have chosen a description where there is no way to keep track of some of the information which the detailed dynamics themselves actually still preserve. \\n \\n:::::Similarly in the example of the atom and the photon, if you had the full knowledge of the full wavefunction of everything, the assumption of unitary evolution means that you ''should'' be able to run that forwards or backwards to get to the state of the universe at any other time.  Given the state, not just of the atom and the photon but of the rest of the universe as well, under unitarity no information is destroyed, and in principle an entity with the capabilities of Laplace's demon ''could'' retrodict where that photon had come from.  On the other hand, if we ignore that (in quantum mechanics) both are unavoidably connected to the rest of the universe, again that is a simplifying approximation made by us, but one which has the effect that our description no longer reflects the full underlying dynamics, and from then on some information coded in the relationship of the atom and the photon to the rest of the universe is being ignored.  This looks like coarse-graining again.\\n\\n:::::The black hole information paradox arises from the same assumed world-view once more: that in a full quantum description, the dynamics should be deterministic, reversible, and information preserving (unitary).  The assumption is that the dynamics aren't throwing information away, we are.  The challenge is to (a) confirm this, and (b) to try to work out where.   Hawking's recent work has been on (a) - to try to produce a picture in which it is clear that information has been conserved, and has not been destroyed and then re-created out of nowhere.  As for (b) - where might coarse-graining by us have lost track of the information, I am no expert in this area, but as I understand it a strong candidate would be in Hawking's semi-classical treatment of the black hole - in a fully quantum treatment, one would expect, in moving to a black hole description with a finite (non-zero) temperature, and a finite (non-infinite) entropy, a full description would identify a finite (non-infinite) collection of states for the black hole, each with amplitudes and phases with respect to the rest of the universe, therein containing information.  My understanding is that Hawking's semi-classical work manages to get answers for the total BH entropy, but ''without'' identifying any finite collection of corresponding distinguishable quantum states for the BH, and this could well be the kind of coarse graining done by us as analysts that messes up the information preservation of underlying unitarity.

That would kinda go against pretty much everything that has been written on quantum mechanics in the last century. Evolution of a wavefunction in a completely quantum mechanical system is unitary, this is a basic fact that you will find in any QM textbook (although may be worded differently). This in particular means one thing, if you would know the wavefunction at some particular time (slice) you can, in principle, calculate the wavefunction at any other time. (This, of course, is a pretty big \\\"if\\\" as it is not physically possible to actual know the wavefunction of the universe since you yourself are part of that same universe.\\n:::::::Now, modern physics is actually plaqued by two major (non)unitarity problems. It seems that your misunderstandig of the first is causing your inability to understand the second. The first non(unitarity) problem is the so called [[measurement problem]], in which a \\\"magic\\\" act of measurement cause the instantanuous collapse of the wavefunction. This instantanuous collapse of the wavefunction is non-unitary, and information is lost in the process. (If the wavefunction truly collapses, it is impossible to reconstruct the state before the collapse from it.)\\n:::::::The second, is black hole unitarity problem (sometimes referred to as the information paradox, but it is unclear that there actual is a paradox). If during the evoltuion of a wavefunction a black hole is formed, and that black hole completely evaporates through the process first described by Hawking. Then the calculations show that this evolution is not unitary, the end state contains no more information about the begin state then a few quantum numbers. \\n:::::::In the last few decades understanding of problems has been converging on the notion that both are caused by the inherently semiclassical nature in which they have been treated. In the case, of the measurement problem the culprit seems to be that while the measured system is treated quantum mechanically, the observer is not. If the observer  is replaced by a quantum mechanical system it can be shown that while the interactions between the observer and the measured system cause the wavefunction of the measured system to collapse to a classical mixed state, the evolution of the combined wavefunction of both systems is in fact unitary. The information about the original state of the measured system is not lost but smeared out over the (considering the percieved classical nature of the observer) very large number of degrees of freedom of the observer. This process is called [[decoherence]], that it is real can be attested to be the people working on quantum computing because it is a major pain in their ass. Now, decoherence is not (yet?) been completely succesful in explain how a final classical pure state is picked, this might require the adoptation of a many-worlds type of interpretation, but it has in fact the unitarity problem in measurements.\\n:::::::The black hole unitarity problem is expected to have a similar cause and resolution. The percieved non-unitarity is expected to result from the classical treatment of the black hole geometry, which effectively gives the black hole (horizon) infinitely many states. A proper quantum mechanical treatment is expected to restore the finite number of states in the black hole, and the unitary evolution of the complete system.

Maybe part of what TimothyRias writes above should be included in the article.

The information in the world's libraries has not been 'extracted' from the natural world; it is the cumulative product of human observation and reflection. If you burn a library the information is not dissipated into the atmosphere; it is destroyed. The metaphysical concept of the 'Conservation of Information' appears to have been invented by the Christian Creationist William Dembski [see his book \\\"Intelligent Design: The Bridge Between Science & Theology\\\"] in order to \\\"prove\\\" that evolution of complex organisms from simple organisms is \\\"impossible\\\" and violates some imaginary law of conservation of genetic information. It is based upon unsubstantiated dogma rather than being deduced from scientific observation. --[[User:Tediouspedant|Tediouspedant]] ([[User talk:Tediouspedant|talk]]) 13:56, 7 February 2010 (UTC)\\n::You are completely correct, of course.

Quantum evolution of a system is unitairy, meaning that the evolution operator is unitairy. In particular, this means that the time evolution of the system can be inverted (at least mathematically).

Even in quantum mechanics all information about the future and the past of a system is contained in the wave function. The wave function itself is not an observable, which makes it impossible to exactly know the wavefunction at a given time. The problem with black holes is that their presence seemingly causes the wave function to forget about its past, which is not possible in a completely quantum mechanical system.[[User:TimothyRias|TimothyRias]] ([[User talk:TimothyRias|talk]]) 07:58, 24 June 2010 (UTC)\\n\\n== Expanding Main approaches to the solution of the paradox ==\\n\\nThe section \\\"Main approaches to the solution of the paradox\\\" should mention the [[Holographic principle]], however, I am not able to provide deep enough inside to write about (dis)advantages...

The holographic principle as used in a resolution of this paradox implies that the information is encoded at the event horizon of a black hole, and is released as part of the Hawking radiation. Therefore it's part of the approach given, ''Information gradually leaks out during the black-hole evaporation''. However, it might be worth expanding on the holographic principle and black hole complementarity in another section of this article.

In IT, the more unexpected a signal is, the greater the information it carries.  If you come to me every day at noon and report that the sun is still working, you have conveyed very little information since that report was expected.   On the other hand if you report that the sun is no longer working, you have conveyed a lot of information.  It is so unexpected that I would suspect I was getting information about a failure of the sensor or the reporter.\\n\\nThe English language has structure.  The letter ''u'' usually follows ''q''.  A ''u'' after a ''q'' conveys very little information.  If I have a book that has the same number of characters as does the ''Encyclopedia Britannica'', but all the letters in it were selected at random, the book of random characters has more information.  But that book is composed of characters in straight lines.  I can get even more information by letting each page be random black and white dots.\\n\\nSo, you have a black hole and you drop ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' into it.  A long time later the black hole eventually evaporates and the ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' comes out as random thermal radiation.  Not only was no information lost but the process actually increased information.\\n\\nIncreasing entropy is equivalent to generating information.  But information is not the same as meaning or knowledge. [[User:Constant314|Constant314]] ([[User talk:Constant314|talk]]) 04:33, 13 April 2011 (UTC)\\n\\n:Entropy is the opposite of information, so more entropy means less information. But what does this has to do with the article? Discussion over articles is about what we should put in them and structure them. [[User:Cogiati|Cogiati]] ([[User talk:Cogiati|talk]]) 08:07, 27 July 2011 (UTC)\\n\\n::In quantum mechanics information is conserved so increasing entropy doesn't create or destroy information. It simply scrambles it increasing the amount of fine grain information at the expense of the coarse grain information. A page with random dots has more fine grain information than a page of text but it has less coarse grain information. That explains how the two statements above that seem contradictory are actually both correct, if interpreted correctly. Constant314 is talking about fine grain information which is indeed increased by entropy. Cogiati is talking about coarse grain information which is indeed decreased by entropy. And the article is talking about total information which is preserved by quantum mechanics evolution operators. The increase in fine grain information achieved by dropping the encyclopedia in a black hole and then collecting the thermal radiation as described by Constant314 makes sense but you don't need a black hole to do that. Burning the encyclopedia would have a similar effect. But that's not what the article is talking about. The article is about the far more subtle question of whether black holes actually do preserve total (fine plus coarse) information as required by quantum mechanics. Stephen Hawking pointed out some strong theoretical reasons to believe that black holes may violate that tenet of quantum mechanics. But without information conservation quantum mechanics doesn't work, hence the theoretical paradox.

Once the perfectly uniform state of maximum entropy has been reached, how can you retrieve information about the past when you know every possible history leads to the same uniform final state? In other words, shouldn't the post-heat death wavefunction of a universe where Hitler won WWII be equal to the post-heat death wavefunction of a universe where Hitler lost WWII and doesn't that imply loss of information? Or is this not what is meant by \\\"conservation of information\\\", is it enouh that after the heat death you could still know how much information the universe could ahve contained in the past, even though you cannot know which information existed at a certain point in time? But if that is the case then why is/was the \\\"black hole information paradox\\\" a paradox; a bigger black hole should produce more raditation when it vaporizes, so you would be able to infer how much matter fell into it and therefore how much information the universe could have contained before the stuff fell into the black hole? In any case the relation between increasing entropy (the loss of information as information is normally understood) and this \\\"conservation of information\\\" law isn't clearly stated in the article.[[Special:Contributions/89.99.122.33|89.99.122.33]] ([[User talk:89.99.122.33|talk]]) 13:06, 5 May 2013 (UTC)\\n\\n:Read my comment above (under the information theory heading) to see how the word information means different things depending on the context.

In other words: If it turns out that quantum mechanics needs to be modified, you may not be able to rely on quantum mechanics to solve the paradox. Said that, most physicists nowadays believe that the paradox resolution will preserve all quantum mechanics tenets, but as of today, the paradox is real and cannot be wished away by tunneling or entanglement or other such things.

Mathematically it can be shown that this occurs when the dynamical equation conserves extension in phase space (classical mechanics) or evolves unitarily (quantum mechanics). This entropy is unfortunately only one of many ways used to quantify the information we have about the state of a system, and the present reference to [[physical information]] is not clear since that article is vague and over-wordy.\\n\\nIt would be good to clarify early on in the article (right in the first sentence, even) exactly what is being talked about. And perhaps to clarify that the worrying point about black holes is not whether they destroy information in the casual sense of thermodynamic irreversibility (that the black holes munge up anything that goes into them, into an effectively random mess). Black holes do \\\"destroy information\\\" in that sense, but in this way they are no different from any other thermodynamic system. However for many practical purposes this sort of destruction is the main point about black holes. If you tell the average person that a black hole does not destroy the information contained in a radio a message they sent into a black hole, they will imagine that their radio signal should somehow be re-emitted intact later on. (The idea is just as strange as if you said that the atmosphere does not destroy information when you shout at it, that you will hear your voice shouted back at you in a year.)\\n\\nOf course whether black holes violate the general mechanical principle of conserving Gibbs entropy, is super important on a fundamental level. In practice I doubt it matters much, since chaotic behaviour and the inability of our brains/computers to perfectly track and utilize fine-scale information means that, in effect, information becomes spontaneously lost in ''all'' thermodynamic systems.

In other words, they would be macroscopically very simple and predictable, but microscopically chaotic. \\\"Thus, like weather forecasting on Earth, information will effectively be lost, although there would be no loss of unitarity.\\\" It's that distinction between unitarily-preserved information and effectively-lost information (a la [[H-theorem]]) that I think is worth clearly stating in this article, as it concerns the former.

And the preceding eternal state is the Eternally Collapsing Object state.One of the outstanding puzzles of theoretical physics is whether quantum information indeed gets lost in the case of Black Hole (BH) evaporation or accretion. Let us recall that Quantum Mechanics (QM) demands an upper limit on the acceleration of a test particle. On the other hand, it is pointed out here that, if a Schwarzschild BH would exist, the acceleration of the test particle would blow up at the event horizon in violation of QM. Thus the concept of an exact BH is in contradiction of QM and quantum gravity (QG). It is also reminded that the mass of a BH actually appears as an INTEGRATION CONSTANT of Einstein equations. And it has been shown that the value of this integration constant is actually zero. Thus even classically, there cannot be finite mass BHs though zero mass BH is allowed. It has been further shown that during continued gravitational collapse, radiation emanating from the contracting object gets trapped within it by the runaway gravitational field. As a consequence, the contracting body attains a quasi-static state where outward trapped radiation pressure gets balanced by inward gravitational pull and the ideal classical BH state is never formed in a finite proper time. In other words, continued gravitational collapse results in an \\\"Eternally Collapsing Object\\\" which is a ball of hot plasma and which is asymptotically approaching the true BH state with M=0 after radiating away its entire mass energy. And if we include QM, this contraction must halt at a radius suggested by highest QM acceleration. In any case no EH is ever formed and in reality, there is no quantum information paradox.\\n\\nPlease see to these--\\n* http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0504076\\n* http://mnrasl.oxfordjournals.org/content/367/1/L66\\n* http://www.natureasia.com/en/nindia/article/10.1038/nindia.2010.35\\n* https://www.academia.edu/1747624/No_Black_Hole_According_To_General_Relativity_Nature_India_\\n\\nAs Abhas Mitra's solution has been supported, We wikipedians should improve the page or create another page on Mitra's pure mathematical proofs and Mitra VS Hawking quagmire  <!-- Template:Unsigned --><small><span class=\\\"autosigned\\\">\\u2014&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Editor1729|Editor1729]] ([[User talk:Editor1729|talk]] \\u2022 [[Special:Contributions/Editor1729|contribs]]) 12:09, 7 July 2016 (UTC)</span></small> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->\\n\\n* {{reply|Editor1729}} Mitra's solution does not appear to be the mainstream thinking on this topic. Not being an expert on physics in any manner, I'm not qualified to evaluate Mitra's work, but that's the point of Wikipedia: we're not supposed to rely on our own evaluation of information, but rather on reliable published sources. It is true that Mitra has published several papers on his own hypotheses regarding black holes, but it is also true that those papers appear to have been largely ignored by the larger scientific community (much to Mitra's consternation, based on some of the published sources). Mitra is a vocal proponent for his own hypotheses and has made several appeals to mass media (reports in ''Indian Times'', etc.), and this present editing effort could be seen as part of that crusade to push his work more to the forefront. I would recommend that we allow Mitra's hypotheses to be presented among the postulated solutions section, but that we not give his hypotheses [[WP:UNDUE|undue weight]] since the larger scientific community has chosen not to accept his solution as the last word on the matter. <font color=\\\"green\\\">[[User:WikiDan61|WikiDan61]]</font><font color=\\\"green\\\" size=\\\"5px\\\"></font><sup>[[User talk:WikiDan61|ChatMe!]]</sup><sub>[[Special:Contributions/WikiDan61|ReadMe!!]]</sub> 12:37, 7 July 2016 (UTC)\\n\\n*: {{ec}} One of the ways to give Mitra's work undue weight is to move his claims to the article lead.

I'm not an expert, but ABO genes and Rhesus genes are independently assorted, so you'd expect that to be reflected in the percentages of each type. So for example, Denmark's population has 35% O+ and 6% O- blood compared to 37% A+ and 7% A- blood, so the per-centages of O and A types that are Rhesus negative are 14.6 and 18.9 respectively, and the difference may well be exaggerated by rounding. In Argentina's case we have 85.4 & 8.4 and 34.26 & 0.44%, ie 8.95% are negative if they're O types compared to 1.27% of A types.[[User:Umbl|Umbl]] ([[User talk:Umbl|talk]]) 04:23, 28 January 2009 (UTC)\\n\\nActually, having looked at the reference again and jammed it through an online translator, it looks like a careless misuse of data. The numbers given for O-, A-, B- and AB- are in fact all the per-centages of Rhesus D negative for a sample of Argentians, but the 4 are noting how it combines with Rhesus C/c and E/e antigens - nothing to do with the ABO groups at all. These number have then, logically, been subtracted off the overall values for the ABO groups to give the O+, A+, B+ and AB+ figures. So all the Argentinian figures are wrong. Since the reference does give the overall % for O, A, B and AB, and the overall % for Rhesus D negative (9.1%), I think I'll correct the table with figures assuming idealised independent assortment, as this will be much closer to the truth than is on there now. A better reference will need to be found.[[User:Umbl|Umbl]] ([[User talk:Umbl|talk]]) 07:20, 28 January 2009 (UTC)\\n\\n== O (oh) vs 0 (zero) ==\\nIt appears that there is some national variation in the usage of O (oh) vs 0 (zero).

The THEORY of dietary linkage to blood type has certainly not been proven, but it very likely IS testable if a credible nutritional scientist could ever muster the courage and take the career risk to conduct such tests.

The pictures are correct, the plasma compatibility table was wrong in the recent version. I corrected this table for the new version. The reason for this opposite correlation is that the blood group is defined by the cells (also for the plasma for consistency). Therefore, O plasma has antibodies against A and B, called anti-A and anti-B while AB plasma has no antibodies against A or B. Therefore, AB plasma can be given to all ABO types while O plasma can be given only to people with blood group O.

Although the name was hereditary, it was possessed only by the head of the family. Hence when it awarded to Drusus, it simultaneously went also to his elder surviving son, who may have been originally called Nero Claudius Drusus or Ti. Claudius Nero, but is known to us as Germanicus. As I understand it, when Germanicus died in 19, the name was passed onto his eldest son, Nero Julius Caesar. When Nero died in 30, he had no issue so the name went across to Germanicus' second eldest son, Drusus Julius Caesar. Drusus Caesar died issueless in 33, whence the name was passed across to Germanicus' third son, Caius Julius Caesar (Caligula). Caligula thus only became Germanicus in 33, upon the death of his eldest survivng brother.[[Special:Contributions/82.44.82.115|82.44.82.115]] ([[User talk:82.44.82.115|talk]]) 16:32, 29 July 2008 (UTC)\\n:Not exactly true, the emperor Claudius had the name '''Tiberius Claudius Drusus Nero Germanicus''' ''before'' his accession upon Caligula's death, undermining your point that it was merely held by the eldest surviving son. Claudius, brother of Germanicus himself was a second son of the aforementioned Drusus the Elder. As far as I know the name Germanicus was one given to Caligula at birth. -- [[user:fdewaele|fdewaele]], 29 July 2008, 22:00 CET\\n\\nHiya. Yes, but Claudius (born Ti. Claudius Drusus) only received the name Germanicus (and Nero)in AD 4, when Germanicus, his elder brother, upon his adoption by Tiberius, became a member of the gens Julia (Tiberius was himself adopted by Augustus at the same time). Although he did not abandon it completely, at that point Germanicus went from using the honorific as an hereditary cognomen to using it as a praenomen (i.e. he became Germanicus Julius Caesar). Upon Germanicus' passing out of the Claudii Nerones and into the Julii Caesares, Claudius became Drusus the Elder's eldest legal son and thus head of the Claudii Nerones (and in doing so also took the name Nero which he did not previously carry), and as a result the honorific should have passed to him alone. \\n\\nGermanicus' sons were all born after his transferance into the Julii Caesares, they never belonged to the Claudii Nerones. My problem is this: on what grounds were Drusus Caesar, Nero Caesar, and Caligula entitled to use the cognomen Germanicus if they were never Claudii Nerones? Maybe it's just safest to assume that by the time his sons were being born, Germanicus had sufficient clout to just ignore the original rule about the name going only to the senior male of that family. After all Claudius, as emperor, seems not to have worried about the rules when naming his own son Germanicus (later Britannicus)...

The consensus was that such tidbits need to be sourced so that it is clear that there actually is a pop song or whatever called \\\"Caligula\\\" and that its significance was such that it made an impact on popular culture. As one editor said ''It's not enough to have a citation that verifies that Hello Kitty appeared in an episode of a random sitcom, you need a citation that analyses the relevance of that appearance of Hello Kitty''. There was agreement that the best thing to do is to move unsourced bits of info like that out of the article onto the talk page to give editors the chance to find sources that establish the accuracy and the impact of the pop song or video game or whatever.

The word caligae would not literally translate to \\\"soldier's boot\\\" as there is no part of the world that means \\\"soldier\\\". The origin of the world is from a covering. If the Roman's had meant for the nickname to imply a little soldier then they would have made that clear. In Latin, it would sound like \\\"little boots\\\".

The exact sentence is : \\\"Croit-on qu'\\u00e0 67 ans, je vais commencer une carri\\u00e8re de dictateur ?\\\" ; and by the way, yes, sometimes he was referring to himself in the third person, even referring to himself as \\\"De Gaulle\\\"...\\n\\n==aircraft carrier==\\n\\nIt's worth mentioning that there is also an aircraft carrier with this name.\\n\\n==Debr\\u00e9 was the actual author==\\n\\nDebr\\u00e9 was the actual author of the ''text'' but the political leader who commissioned the text and decided the general framework is always described as 'the author' because he had the text written, told the authors what to include and ultimately decided the shape of the text, usually exercising a veto over what he wanted in or out of ''his'' text. Hence in Ireland, for example, the constitution was actually written by John Hearne and M\\u00edche\\u00e1l \\u00d3 Gr\\u00edobhtha, but it is always described as Eamon de Valera's constitution, never Hearne's and \\u00d3 Griobhtha's. And Michael Collins is described as the author of the 1922 constitution because it was drafted under a committee under his nominal chairmanship. The same is true of all other constitutions; the author of the text is not described as the author of the constitution, the political leader who ordered its preparation is the person described as the 'author of the constitution', with whomever did the actual drafting called 'author of the text of 'x's constitution'. It is a standard method of reference. [[User:Jtdirl|Fear\\u00c9IREANN]] 20:32, 3 Aug 2003 (UTC)\\n\\nThe Fifth French Republic constitution is neither referred as \\\"la Constitution du G\\u00e9n\\u00e9ral de Goulle\\\" in France.

The issue is not who procedurally introduced the constitution. Michael Collins was dead when ''his'' constitution was introduced. A constitution is described as being by the person who was responsible, theoretically for its preparation. The French constitution is always described internationally as being de Gaulle's constitution, never Debr\\u00e9's; he was merely the author of the text, just as de Valera is described as being the author of the Irish constitution, even though when it came to parliamentary debates it was shown that he had a poor understanding of what was in it and was it meant and the text was produced in two languages by two different people, while Collins rarely even attended the Committee under his nominal chairmanship that drafted the 1922 constitution and was dead when it was in fact introduced by W. T. Cosgrave, who is never ever described as its author. Under political science, the titles \\\"author of the constitution\\\" and \\\"author of the text of the constitution\\\" are not always the same people.  Political scientists refer to ''Nehru's constitution, de Valera's constitution, Karamanlis' constitution, de Gaulle's constitution'' etc even though they may never have written a word and even have never been involved in its legislative enactment, simply because they may have laid down the perameters to the drafter as to what it should contain, may have been the founder of the new state or republic or may simply have been the personification or the era in which the drafting took place.

If you were to add the middle names to all the French people on Wikipedia, good luck ! I think adding all the middle names is actually counterproductive: you have the delusion of informing better people, but you actually confuse people who are not familiar with the nitty-gritties of France. People end up not knowing what is actually the real name of the person, in that case Charles. I would also like to point out to the fact that in France some people are not known by their first christian name, but by their second or third ! So listing all the christian names leads to not knowing for sure what the real name is. In that case, is it Andr\\u00e9 de Gaulle? Joseph de Gaulle? It's not a problem for French people who know who de Gaulle is. But it may be a problem for international readers not familiar with the character. If a US high school kid is gonna use this article for a paper or presentation, he might find it bewildering. Finally, you cannot deny the fact that middle names are much more widely used in the English speaking world than in France. They are part of the name, such as George W. Bush. You would never find Charles A.J.M. de Gaulle, nobody writes like that in France. If you have a look at the official website of the presidential palace in Paris, which lists all the former French presidents, you'll see they do not put middle names. Encyclop\\u00e9die Larousse does not put middle names. Encyclopaedia Universalis does not put middle names. Anyway, long explanation here, but maybe we will set precedent. lol [[User:Hardouin|Hardouin]] 10:20, 2 Jun 2004 (UTC)\\n\\n:You seem to be implying that middle names are used regularly in other countries, but they aren't. Some US politicians use middle initials because they think it makes them look more impressive (in GWB's case it's also to distinguish him from his father, presumably), but most people don't use their middle names or initials at all (I have two middle names and I never use them, and I don't know anyone who uses more than one Christian name or a Christian name and an initial). I doubt many people know that Tony Blair is called \\\"Anthony Charles Lynton Blair\\\", and no one would ever call him that, and yet that's what's at the beginning of his article. And the suggestion that people wouldn't know which name is used when it's the only one in the title of the article is a little odd, to say the least. As to why other articles don't have middle names, it's probably more to do with people not knowing them than with a deliberate decision to leave them out (and if French sources are being as unhelpful as you say, I can't blame them for not knowing). An encyclopaedia is supposed to supply information, and I can't think of any possible disadvantage that supplying a person's full name could bring about.

So I will not add endlessly to that thread. I will just say this, with a totally un-controversial tone: I am understanding the goal of Wikipedia is to be a world multilingual and multicultural encyclopedia, reflecting the cultures and customs of all the countries of the world, and not merely yet another \\\"anglo-saxon\\\" encyclopedia. Thus, as I have noticed, names are always listed as is customary in each native country: English and American names of people list middle names, as is customary there (e.g.: Franklin Delanoe Roosevelt, John Fitzgerald Kennedy), Chinese names of people appear with the family name first as is customary in China (hence Mao Zedong... if you were to write this name following the English pattern of first middle last name that would give: Zedong Runzhi Mao or Dong Ze Mao, depending what you consider a middle name here !). So, logically, I thought French names of people should appear as is customary in France, i.e. without middle names. Of course, I agree an encyclopedia should list as much information as possible, BUT ONLY information that is relevant to the reader! I mean, if I follow you, why didn't we also include de Gaulle's height? color of eye? blood group? exact amount of military decorations received? street address of birth place? The list could go on. In France there is a saying: \\\"Trop d'information tue l'information\\\" (\\\"Too much information kills information\\\"). \\n\\n:Of course, the whole question is then what's relevant to the reader, and what's not, and who decide it. That's what the people in charge of Wikipedia should figure out, no?\\n\\n:Finally, to finish confusing people, in the rare instances when a French full name is written, it DOES NOT contain hyphens. So the full name listed in the article is wrong anyway. Hyphens in French are used only to show that a christian name is a compounded name, e.g. \\\"Jean-Philippe\\\" is ONE christian name, \\\"Jean Philippe\\\" are TWO christian names. One example to help understand, my grand aunt full name was (I delete the family name) \\\"Marie-Antoinette Paule Ernestine\\\", she had thus 3 christian names, and in most occasions of life she went by her first name \\\"Marie-Antoinette\\\" only. So the full name of de Gaulle should in any case be written \\\"Charles Andr\\u00e9 Joseph Marie de Gaulle\\\". But maybe we can solve our angels' gender controversy by starting the article like this: \\n\\n:'''Charles de Gaulle''', full name: Charles Andr\\u00e9 Joseph Marie de Gaulle (November 22, 1890... \\n\\n:Does anyone agree? [[User:Hardouin|Hardouin]] 18:30, 2 Jun 2004 (UTC)\\n\\n::The Wikipedia standard seems to put the most often used name as title, to cite the full name first within in the article body and the colloquial name second (sometimes not even citing the most used name at all in the upper page sum-up, since it is in the title, after all).

The reader pointed out that the name was of dutch roots (I believe that's what was written) and that the dutch tradition commanded the other spelling. The publication answered that, although the reader was right, the general himself had always insisted on the other spelling. Now, I believe the spelling prefered by the general was mentioned as ''De Gaulle'', and the dutch spelling was ''de Gaulle''. Is there a De Gaulle expert or Dutch language expert reading this who can come to our rescue? If the general prefered ''De Gaulle'', I certainly think the main article should be titled as such and the alternate spelling be the redirect page. --[[User:Liberlogos|Liberlogos]] 23:52, 14 Jul 2004 (UTC)\\n\\n:De Gaulle's name is not of Dutch origins. I know it is a die-hard legend in France, probably because de Gaulle was born in Lille near Dutch speaking territories, and a name starting with \\\"de\\\" is typical in Dutch, but actually it is his mother's side who was from the area of Lille, NOT his father's family, from whom he owes his family name. The \\\"de Gaulle\\\" are a very old family of aristocratic decent, originating in Normandy in the 14th century, local knights of the king of France defending Normandy against the English during the War of Hundred Years (History is ironical I guess!). This fact was confirmed recently by de Gaulle's son in the book he published about his father last year. \\\"de\\\" in French means \\\"of\\\" and is typical of French aristocratic names, equivalent to Von in Germany, and Van in Holland. During the French Revolution, like many aristocrats, the de Gaulle family changed their name into Gaulle, without the \\\"de\\\", to avoid problems with the revolutionaries. After the revolution they put the \\\"de\\\" again. In France, de Gaulle's name is listed under letter G, and not under letter D. This is customary for aristocratic names. But the family was always discreet about its aristocratic origins, actually I think many French people would be surprised to know that de Gaulle is really an aristocratic name (many names starting with \\\"de\\\" in France are fake, and not aristocratic at all). It's only with the book published by his son last year that the point was made clear.\\n:[[User:193.114.111.34|193.114.111.34]] 19:09, 15 Jul 2004 (UTC)\\n\\nIn Dutch small articles like \\\"de\\\" have their case depend on context.

Otherwise, the modification should reflect that France had the fourth satellite in orbit, not the third.\\n\\nRegards,\\nGeorge Cummings (Montreal)\\n\\nDiamant Rocket + Asterix satellite. Honestly the satellite was very small and not very useful IMO, but  I think France was the third country to built a delivery system.\\n[[User:Ericd|Ericd]] 22:13, 30 Jul 2004 (UTC)\\n\\n:The French satellite was called A-1 (standing in a typical military terse style for Arm\\u00e9e-1, but later nicknamed Ast\\u00e9rix by the media), and was launched by French technicians using a French-designed rocket of the Diamant family. The launch pad was temporarily in the Sahara Desert in newly independent Algeria, and was later moved to French Guiana. So you cannot really compare this with the Canadian satellite which was launched by US technicians using a US rocket. To me the sentence \\\"France was the third country in the world to launch a satellite after the US and USSR\\\" clearly implies that the rocket was French. As a matter of comparison, there have been many French astronauts who went into space on Russian or US rockets, but never on a French or European rocket so far. Nobody would write that France have launched some men into space. So to me the sentence clearly implies the use of a French delivery system. Now if you can think of a cleverer way to rephrase the sentence (without being too convoluted), please let us know.

''Charles de Gaulle'' is supposedly more neutral, but ''g\\u00e9n\\u00e9ral de Gaulle'' is now so widely accepted that using ''Charles de Gaulle'' in conversation definitely carries a feeling of distance, or covert criticism.

Rama, the mention on this talk page above, dated July 15, 2004, which I wrote, is not a hoax! Thank you. The de Gaulle family had indeed aristocratic origins, which the son of de Gaulle confirmed in the book ''De Gaulle, mon p\\u00e8re''. The oldest known ancestor is Richard de Gaulle who was an equerry of King Philip Augustus of France, and who was enfeoffed in Normandy in 1210, very near the border of Ile-de-France. Around the time of Joan of Arc there's a Jehan de Gaulle who fought during the Battle of Agincourt. The exact origin of the name is not quite clear (there's a genealogical review in France (G\\u00e9n\\u00e9alogie-Magazine) that had a dossier about de Gaulle's ancestry, and this maybe would give a final answer, but I don't have it with me). However, I don't see how the name de Gaulle could come from Dutch origins, since the family was in Normandy since remote times. Yes, de Gaulle was born in Lille, in previously Dutch speaking area, but it is his mother's family who was from French flanders (formerly Dutch speaking), not his father's family who has no connection with Flanders whatsoever. [[User:Hardouin|Hardouin]] 16:33, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)\\n*'''Oppose'''.

What makes you - rather \\\"made you\\\" - noble was your \\\"lettres de noblesse\\\" from the king, or simply the job that you had in this time (if you held a certain position in the society like judge or minister or any high office you may think about - except, in theory, trade and industry).\\nTo be from noble ascent or not has absolutly no meaning anymore today and does not play any role. As for the past it did not play the role whe often think it had : the only really  important title in the \\\"Ancien R\\u00e9gime\\\" was the one of \\\"Duc\\\", the rest was often given \\\"par complaisance\\\" or for money problems (a way for the king to fill up the treasury because you had to pay for it). In one word, to be noble in the ancient times was just like being in the Who's Who today. Nothing more. The modern view about nobility is of pure fantasy. De Gaulle himself never made any mention of it, nor private nor public, and I doubt he would have pride himself to be the son of a duke had he been one.\\nNow, for the origins of his family, there is no proof at all that the de Gaulle that you find in the Midddle Ages in Normandy should be related to Charles. No proof also that the name de Gaulle should be from Dutch origins. Remember all of this is only speculation, perhaps true, perhaps not - and ''check your informations''. The assured facts are the following : his first certain ancestors from his father side where traders in Champagne in the 17th century. The family then bought some office to become lawyers and moved to Paris in the 18th century. They may have been considered as noble then since two of Charles de Gaulle's direct ancestors held an office in the \\\"Parlement de Paris\\\", but I never saw any mention of it quoting some real document. Anyhow Charles de Gaulle was born in a 20 years old Republic (1890), and his father family, made of historians, writers and teachers, penniless intellectuals, was of much more humble condition than his mother side, tipically bourgeois and much richer, who used to play a real role in the northern France society.\\nFor further reading on de Gaulle's family see : J.

ProhibitOnion seems to have a deep hatred for de Gaulle. I personaly think that in this article we should neither worship nor denigrate the personality and actions of de Gaulle. We should just try as much as possible to present his life and his actions in a factual neutral way. All the comments about how much people in the UK and in the US disliked the policy of de Gaulle are a bit out of place. There are about 180 countries in the world. If we start to list all the feelings toward de Gaulle in all these 180 countries, then this article will become a real mess. As far as I know, when we have articles about Margaret Thatcher or Ronald Reagan, these articles do not tell us what Chinese, German, or French people thought about these two leaders. So why should the de Gaulle article list what UK and US public opinions thought about de Gaulle? If we start listing public opinions feelings, then we could write something about how Brazilian, Mexican, or Argentinian public opinions loved de Gaulle frequent snubing at the US, or how African and Asian public opinions supported his rejection of a bipolar world.

Who were the two main Allied countries who fought for and liberated France (at massive cost/loss of life)?

I hadn't thought of any connection to the Hexagon until now. Whatever the case, the article is a current featured article candidate, so whatever I added can't have been that bad.\\n\\nAs far as any \\\"personal\\\" \\\"hatred\\\" of CDG goes, it is hardly \\\"neutral\\\" to describe many of his actions and statements without pointing out that they often had strong repercussions among France's notional ''allies''; certainly, outside France he was, and remains, a controversial figure. Among his actions that brought this about: Lecturing the Americans about Vietnam, keeping the British out of the EEC, withdrawing from the NATO command structure but staying in the alliance, telling Quebeckers to separate from Canada, switching sides in the Arab-Israeli conflict, and claiming to be a \\\"counterweight\\\" to the western alliance while being part of it.\\n\\nDo these actions have something in common? Yes: They were gesture politics. Many of these shows of independence were designed for a domestic audience and widely applauded, and from a French perspective this may seem to be the end of the story. But his audacious political statements were often regarded as empty, and usually counterproductive, abroad. In the case of the Montreal speech, which Hardoin deleted at one point because it was an ostensibly \\\"minor\\\" issue, it was not seen that way in Canada, where a visiting head of state was seen to be encouraging a separatist movement. This was one of the few occasions in which the French press later wondered whether he'd gone too far; and perhaps it was analyzed too much in Canada (he had failed to liberate France, so he wanted to liberate Quebec instead; the usual \\\"spitting on the graves of France's liberators\\\"; etc. etc.). But it was, for one of France's closest allies, the moment for which he will be remembered.\\n\\nIt's hard to think of a country outside France where the consensus on CDG is overwhelmingly positive; for the Poles, he was the brave soldier and brilliant strategist who helped them defend their independence against the Soviets in 1920, but he was quick to abandon them (the \\\"First Ally\\\" that had never collaborated) to the Soviets as WWII ended and to claim France, not Poland, as one of the victors. To other countries of Central Europe, he was happy to cozy up to the Soviet Union, seemingly accepting the USSR's \\\"sphere of influence\\\" (even if the issue was more complicated and France was ultimately an anti-communist power). For the British, he was the heroic general who stood up to the Nazis, but he was also the one who told the French they had liberated themselves, and who later kept Britain out of the EEC for a mixture of ideological and commercial reasons; to the Americans he was an unreliable ally whose talk of a \\\"counterweight\\\" was little more than bluster, but hardly helpful in the face of the communist threat.\\n\\nWhether these positions are \\\"correct\\\" is not the point, and few denied he was a savvy politician. But, as you point out, he frequently \\\"snubbed\\\" the US, Britain, and other allies, sometimes playing to rather base prejudices in other countries.\\n\\nHardoin mentions other important political figures: If the articles about Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan, and the like did not point out there was great resistance to their policies, that they were at times broadly unpopular abroad, and that they often followed a course that went against the conventional wisdom, then these articles would be incomplete. \\n\\n--[[User:ProhibitOnions|ProhibitOnions]] 21:13, 2005 May 20 (UTC)\\n\\nAn excellent critique.

[[User:David.Monniaux|David.Monniaux]] 08:52, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)\\n\\n== Some changes ==\\n\\nI think it would be accurate to re-examine the following points, which are dubious according to me :\\n- \\\"Their social ideas were also more liberal\\\".\\nI think \\\"liberal\\\" is not suited for such a family - in French, De Gaulle would not be said as being a ''\\\"lib\\u0117ral\\\"'', and in English neither -. \\\"labor-friendly\\\" would be better.\\n:The word \\\"liberal\\\" should be avoided, or at least used with caution, since it means different things to different people or countries. Especially since on en: many Americans apply it indifferently to mean \\\"left-wing\\\".\\n\\n- \\\"He was promoted to major and offered possibility of a further career in Poland\\\".\\nAre you sure that after being a captain, he was promoted major ? Major is a lower rank than captain ...\\n:It's US terminology for \\\"commander\\\". If I remember well, \\\"major\\\" in France is a NCO rank in certain forces.\\n\\n- \\\"Prime Minister Paul Reynaud promoted him provisional brigadier general\\\".\\n\\\"Brigadier general\\\" sounds weird, since this was not used for a general since the royalty. Moreover, \\\"brigadier\\\" is a very low rank in the police. \\\"G\\u00e9n\\u00e9ral de brigade\\\" would be better.\\n\\n- \\\"De Gaulle was elected President by the parliament with 78% of the vote\\\".\\nHe was not elected by the parliament, but by a special electoral body composed of \\\"great voters\\\" (delegates of city councils, \\\"conseillers g\\u00e9n\\u00e9raux\\\" and so on).\\n:The English phrase for this is \\\"electoral college\\\".\\n\\n- \\\"Internationally he rebuffed both the United States and the Soviet Union.\\\"\\nThis is going too far ; he was not between West and East, but he wanted France to be independent INSIDE the western world. Anti-communism was a steady tread in gaullism.\\n\\n- \\\"Although his supporters would argue that subsequent British ambivalence toward the EU justified his fears, many Britons took De Gaulle's \\\"non\\\" as a deep insult. British commentators have suggested that Britain's later lack of enthusiasm for the EU was due precisely to it being a project to which Britain was not invited during its formative years. As a result of De Gaulle's snub, it is asserted, instead of genuinely embracing all European democracies, the EU became a platform tailor-made for French ambitions but serving British needs poorly.\\\"\\nThis is repeted twice (1958-1962 and 1962-1968) and is unaccurate : Britain WAS invited to the EU during its formative years, but Churchill, though a supporter of the EU idea, refused, for he thought it was a \\\"continental\\\" thing. The end of the passage is over-simplistic UKIP propaganda.\\n\\n- On the redaction of the constitution : CDG was not president at this time, but President of the Ministers Council (Prime Minister) and Debr\\u00e9 was Minister of Justice. The constitution was a compromise between both of them (Debr\\u00e9 wanted a British-style parliamentary system, CDG wanted a strong president), and the project was co-writed by a consultative committee. So I would  not say that CDG \\\"wrote\\\" the constitution, but \\\"inspired\\\" it (esp. through the \\\"Discours de Bayeux\\\", a famous speech in 1946, rejecting the constitution of the 4th Republic. This speech is the description of De Gaulle's constitutional ideas which took shape in 1958, so it would very relevant to mention it.)\\n\\n- In the passage about CDG and the EU, it would be accurate to include a sentence about the \\\"politique de la chaise vide\\\" (or empty-chair policy) in the EU ministers council ; France being unrepresented, it blocked the EU institutions. CDG wanted a more intergouvernmental and less federalist-style management in the EU institutions.\\n\\n- in the passage about May 1968, I would mention the \\\"Accords de Grenelle\\\", which ended the workers strike which solidarized with the students, so the students were alone in strike again. (labour-employers agreements about salaries and trade-unions representation inside the companies to end the general strike).\\n\\n- The constitution and the colonies. Oversea territories voted for the referendum about the constitution :\\n- if the answer was \\\"no\\\", it meant the immediate independence (Ghana) ;\\n- if the answer was \\\"yes\\\", then the local assembly had to choose between the integration in the French Republic (DOM-TOM) or the associate status inside the French Union (short-lived).\\n\\nIt's the first time I participate to a discussion in a Wikipedia article, so I would like somebody more into the system to check the changes I propose and to make them.\\n\\n:Brigadier general is the English translation of ''g\\u00e9n\\u00e9ral de brigade''. It ought to be left as it is. On the other hand, I totally agree with what you say about de Gaulle and British entry into the UK. The article was much more neutral on that point before, until the apparently anti-de Gaulle user ProhibitOnions completely rewrote the chapter about de Gaulle presidency, and wrote the entire passage about British entry that you quoted. It needs to be reverted back to the original neutral article. [[User:Hardouin|Hardouin]] 17:16, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)\\n\\nPlease see my remarks in the passage above. If you have a better way to phrase the British cynicism about the EU as a \\\"French project\\\" please do so. If you read the passage again, it is not \\\"UKIP propaganda\\\" but an attempt to express in a few words one common, and in this case pertinent, form of British disillusionment with the EEC, which was voiced frequently around the time of accession and before the 1975 British referendum on remaining within the union. --[[User:ProhibitOnions|ProhibitOnions]] 21:24, 2005 May 20 (UTC)\\n\\n== de Gaulle's most infamous quote ==\\n\\nAmong the French (I can say this since I am French myself), most of us know de Gaulle's most infamous quote that is sometimes used to dishonour him or to try to legitimate harsh actions against immigration:\\n''\\u00ab C'est tr\\u00e8s bien qu'il y ait des Fran\\u00e7ais jaunes, des Fran\\u00e7ais noirs, des Fran\\u00e7ais bruns.

The benefits of this democratic information revolution are hardly quantifiable, but the freedom that the Internet affords also creates new reason for caution. We see this quite clearly in many personal websites with clear biases or inaccuracies, but with regard to the recent popularity of Wikipedia.org, can we truly count on it to be error- and bias-free? While the articles may indeed contain a very few errors, accuracy cannot be stated strictly in terms of the empirical integrity of the articles contents. Indeed, the accuracy of statements contained within an article may not betray inaccuracies generated by omission of context or the inclusion of distracting or unneeded information. It is with this question of the nature of so-called reliable information in mind that we approach an article about Charles de Gaulle, an undeniably important figure in the 20th century history of France.\\n\\tIn reading about Charles de Gaulle\\u2019s influence on the France in the 20th century, one discerns a particular reverence toward him as a leader, especially when addressing his service in the Free French Forces as well his role in the founding of the Fifth republic. With statements like, \\u201c[a]s a junior member of the French government, he opposed unsuccessfully proposals to surrender.\\u201d He seems to be portrayed as a lone brave Frenchmen, but the article fails to provide us with the necessary context to verify this. Was he in the minority? Why were his desires suppressed? Who was it that ultimately suppressed his views? While a great many sources may or may not addresses these questions, with Wikipedia\\u2019s vast number of seemingly arbitrary links to reference articles, perhaps the author might link to articles that do in fact answer various questions about the context, in this case, of de Gaulle\\u2019s opposition to the surrender of French forces. \\n\\tWhile I would hesitate to call reverence for de Gaulle\\u2019s achievements a very significant bias, it is with a certain amount of bias that every author approaches his or her topic of choice. The effects of this bias are mitigated in the professional and academic world through editorial and peer review controls, but the volunteer nature of Wikipedia may prevent the bias of the author from being minimized. One such example of this bias is an apparent glossing over of details that might mar the hero-like image painted of de Gaulle in the beginning of the article. With one short sentence, \\\" De Gaulles government covered up the Paris massacre of 1961\\u201d [sic], the author mentions this embarrassing episode with no mention of how or why they decided to cover up the event. While I don\\u2019t know that this was intentional, it does indeed raise important questions for one not familiar with the recent history of France. Was this a truly important event being downplayed or was this a minor event that has been included for thoroughness? \\n\\tDespite the article\\u2019s reverent nature, I feel it does provide a good overview of the life of Charles de Gaulle. This overview status puts Wikipedia in a very interesting position in defining its identity. Wikipedia\\u2019s articles seem to range from attempting to provide a cursory overview, with several links to references or more focused articles, to an attempt at providing a comprehensive source of information, with only links to other Wikipedia articles (perhaps the Internet equivalent of a scholarly article only referencing scholarly articles?). This identity crisis, leads one to be insecure about a great deal of what is read on the website. If an article is too short, one might question the importance of what the article is about. If the article is too long, one might question the validity of it\\u2019s contents (\\u201cHow could volunteers/hobbyists know so much about this topic?\\u201d). \\n\\tThe author(s) attempt to answer these questions in their citations, but I feel that this is where Wikipedia truly fails. The adherence to online-only citations leaves a 1000-word article with only a few citations of popular news sites, one online \\u201cCharles de Gaulle database\\u201d, and innumerable links to other Wikipedia or wiki-based websites. This reliance on free on-line resource fails to truly solve the problem of pseudo-expertise of volunteers/hobbyists. I believe the credence given to Wikipedia, if not in the popular world, certainly in the scholarly world would be greatly increased were they to begin citing scholarly books and articles, even if they were not freely (as in cost) available.\\nDespite the issue of sometimes-questionable reliability, if we leave Wikipedia in its place of an overview resource, I believe it can serve as a wonderful starting point for research on any number of topics. The nature of the Internet and the spirit of volunteerism are wonderful things, but I believe the integrity of articles on Wikipedia should be at least questioned before being accepted. The article on de Gaulle serves as a fine example of the cooperative authorship that Wikipedia can accomplish\\u2014that of delivering a thorough overview of a person or issue, but it seems that every section of the article leaves the reader with questions about the implication, context, or motivations of an event or time-period. These questions in the future may be answered on Wikipedia, but for now, the best source of answers to such questions is normally an academic article.\\n\\n::How can people take the time to write so much questions on the talk page instead of improving the article ?\\n::BTW : see http://fr.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761563271/Gaulle_Charles_de.html [[User:Ericd|Ericd]] 20:50, 27 March 2006 (UTC)\\n\\n::\\u201c[a]s a junior member of the French government, he opposed unsuccessfully proposals to surrender.\\u201d He seems to be portrayed as a lone brave Frenchmen, but the article fails to provide us with the necessary context to verify this.

Inasmuch as de Gaulle viewed recognition of the PRC as an important step toward a negotiated neutralisation of mainland Southeast Asia (specifically, the old territories of Indochina) then yes, there is some value in this comparison. Nixon also viewed recognition of China as an important step toward a negotiated settlement in Vietnam -- although whether Nixon's \\\"honourable peace\\\" is in any real sense equivalent to de Gaulle's vision of neutralisation is questionable. De Gaulle had other motives however, not least of which was his desire to demonstrate French independence of action vis-a-vis the United States (which applied considerable pressure on its allies to toe the line on non-recognition of the PRC). At any rate, the sentence in question doesn't make clear what \\\"conclusion\\\" de Gaulle (or Nixon) came to here. I was just going to delete this sentence, but since there is some information re de Gaulle and Nixon in the next sentence (unrelated to China btw) I have left it for time being.\\n\\nDe Gaulle was not alone to fight against the surrender.

[[User:Med|Med]] 09:16, 21 March 2007 (UTC)\\n::::::::While I am not convinced, nor do I agree with some of the aforementioned comments, I am willing to retract my suggestion that anti-semitic/racist remarks be included in the article since I am not an expert on De Gaulle. While certain credible sources have mentioned his impartiality (such as The Economist), I feel that somebody with more knowledge of De Gaulle would be more appropriate to argue in favour of their inclusion should that be the case. Separately, I am slightly worried at the impartiality in which this article is being written as it seems to me to have a bias consisting largely of selectively positive comments. There are times when De Gaulle's lack of stated preferences say more than the contrary. For example, De Gaulle advocated for a \\\"Free Quebec\\\" and validated this claim through rhetoric about the \\\"wonders of having this colony of Frenchman along the St.Lawrence river\\\" in a speech he gave shortly after returning to France. This could easily be viewed as an ethnic judgment and it wouldn't be improper for somebody to wonder if that was the case. It is this sort of thing that I was advocating for in the article and to have individuals make up their own mind because there are clearly two ways of viewing this. I feel that not including these remarks can possibly do Wikipedia and the readers an injustice because they are not fairly representing De Gaulle for who he was. They need not be so controversial, simply stated. [[User:Canking|Canking]] 15:45, 31 March 2007 (UTC)\\n::::::::: As you say very well, doing so would be speculation. Wikipedia does not wonder.

So much for attempted objectivity [[User:Canking|Canking]] 19:27, 1 April 2007 (UTC)\\n\\nA newspaper - even ''The Economist''... - should not to be taken as a impartial source for historical research. It is simply not his role and the journalists are very aware that they are writing about today France when they quote de Gaulle.\\nDe Gaulle was obviously not anti-semitic. His closest advisers and the best where Jews, like Ren\\u00e9 Cassin (later promotor of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights) or Michel Debr\\u00e9 (writer of the 5th Republic Constitution). But it is true that he grew up in a right wing national sensibility who included some solid anti-semitic clich\\u00e9s on Jewish plots (spread by D\\u00e9roul\\u00e8de or Maurras). Anyhow, de Gaulle had been so constantly accused during WW2 to serve the interest of the Jews that it is funny to hear on the opposite that he might have been anti-semitic.\\nIn fact, the question of his attitude toward Jews concern rather Israel. It is a sical and political question more than a racial one. Being a \\\"open nationalist\\\", de Gaulle himself was naturally well disposed toward all great national enterprises and had been truly impressed by David Ben Gourion's action and the immense effort of settlements in Palestine. But the realist part of de Gaulle's politics, always very calculated, made him also think that the settlement of the Jews in an hostile region (to be compared in his mind with former French colonies), will mean permanent troubles, and he was worry to see that Israel whas not ready to do more concession in order to live in peace. He was certainly not familiar with the Jewish history, culture and mentality. Moreover, he didn't speak for the Jews or Israelis, but for himself or for his country. The famous sentence \\\"peuple d'\\u00e9lite, s\\u00fbr de lui-m\\u00eame et dominateur\\\" is not only an opinion, it is a political statement and should be analysed as one. Never forget who speaks, when, and where when you consider history. The important fact to understand in 1967 is that from this moment, France (who has strong links whith the Middle east, and de Gaulle used to be posted as a French officer in Lebanon before WW2) will reckon with the Arab side. Which doesn't mean that it will be against Israel, but rather that it won't be aligned on America's foreign policy (think that in 1966 de Gaulle dediced to pull France out of NATO).\\nBesides all of this, let me say that the meaning of the word \\\"dominateur\\\" should not be only understood following a dictionnary or the personal mind of the common speaker - it should be heard from de Gaulle's point of view. And I don't think that for this very person, General in the French army, educated before WW1 in a time when fascination for strenght and power was at its peak, later regulary accused to install a dictatorship in France, and who visited Franco after his retirement in 1969, I do not think that the term was so negative in his mind. I know that de Gaulle's 1967 statement has shocked a lot of people, among who Jews. But it doesn't make de Gaulle an anti-semitic, though clearly, that is true, a non politically correct statesman ! But he though he could say that kind of things because of all he has done against fascism during the war.\\nFor further readings see :\\nDe Gaulle en son si\\u00e8cle vol. 1 : \\\" De Gaulle vu par les Juifs\\\" pp.458-470 \\nDe Gaulle en son si\\u00e8cle vol. 6 : \\\"De Gaulle et le conflit du Proche-Orient\\\" pp. 394-455  <span style=\\\"font-size: smaller;\\\" class=\\\"autosigned\\\">\\u2014Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/83.99.61.129|83.99.61.129]] ([[User talk:83.99.61.129|talk]]) 11:05, 24 March 2009 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->\\n\\n== Photograph ==\\n\\n[[User:Godefroy]], the image [[:Image:DeGaulle.jpg]] you keep reverting to is mediocre, non-Free, and it ''clearly'' is an army uniform (which invalidates your comment [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Charles_de_Gaulle&curid=51255&diff=114853106&oldid=114849853] -- and De Gaulle wore his uniform when he was president as well, so I don't know what you're getting at anyway).\\n\\nFurthermore it is very probable that this image is simply a copyright violation, since we have numerous other photographs, which invalidates the arguments that the image cannot be replaced, which is necessary to invoke fair use.

So stop with the nitpicking please. Also, during his presidency de Gaulle wore almost only civilian clothes. He wore his old military uniform only in some very particular situations, such as when he denounced the military coup in Algiers, or when he toured South America where he thought he would be more recognizable with his military outfit. Those were very rare instances. So again no nitpicking please. The truth is, in the life of de Gaulle there's the military period, and there's the civilian period. I don't think a military picture is appropriate on top of the article, because it reduces de Gaulle only to his military period which is just the first half of his public life. It's a bit as if we had a picture of Eisenhower in military uniform at the beginning of the Eisenhower article.

However, if you can think of a better way of phrasing the point, then offer one. Some Free French troops did participate as a part of British forces on D-day, but not as a separate army (they entered in force later, nominally as part of the American army). Obviously the Resistance participated too. There were perfectly sensible military reasons for this. [[User:Paul Barlow|Paul B]] ([[User talk:Paul Barlow|talk]]) 21:44, 21 November 2013 (UTC)\\n\\n::General de Gaulle was deliberately excluded from the planning and other aspects of the run up to D-Day on the grounds that the operation was too important to take the risk of him messing it up in some way, either by mentioning something in public or to the press that he shouldn't, or discussing it among the wrong people. Churchill and the planners knew that the invasion was a one-off chance and that if it failed they would most likely never be able to try again.\\n\\n::The Free French had unfortunately gained a poor reputation for security in Britain when earlier in the run-up to the [[Battle of Madagascar|Invasion of Madagascar]] Free French solders had been overheard openly discussing the forthcoming invasion ([[Operation Ironclad]]) in London clubs and bars. After that, the French were kept out of such matters.\\n\\n::In addition, it was felt (suspected) that de Gaulle might attempt to take command of French troops and then proceed to mess up the operation by interfering in ways beyond his competence, i.e., not following plans, orders, etc., In other words, that he might become a 'loose cannon' and jeopardise the operation in one way or another. Quite simply, he was thought too much of a risk. Bear in mind that at this point de Gaulle was treading the thin line between soldier and politician.\\n\\n::IIRC, this was all a cause of much of de Gaulle's post-war animosity towards Britain.\\n\\n::OTOH, for the British the view was that they had voluntarily gone into the war in 1939 with France as a formidable ally with one of the largest armies (and navies) in Europe, of over two million men, only for the British to see that army fall apart in 1940 and the French government ultimately surrendering (which they had expressly given assurances to the British they would never do) leaving Britain and her empire metaphorically 'in the s**t' to fight on alone. So when de Gaulle arrived in Britain as a relatively low-ranking army officer he was never regarded by the British as being as important as he felt himself to be.  <small class=\\\"autosigned\\\">\\u2014&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/2.29.18.153|2.29.18.153]] ([[User talk:2.29.18.153|talk]]) 11:30, 29 July 2015 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->\\n:::Well actually, the \\\"formidable\\\" British ally [[Dunkirk evacuation|fled at the first gunshot]] and the French did not surrender but signed an [[armistice]], which is not the same thing.

For instance:\\n\\n\\\"A \\\"Committee of Civil and Army Public Security\\\" was created under the presidency of General Jacques Massu, a Gaullist sympathiser.\\\" - this tells the reader very little except for the name of the institution, without any description or context. (The necessary context being of course that Massu was supporting the settler insurrection - without this, a reader might easily interpret it as the army opposing the settlers in support of the government and security.)\\n\\n\\\"Under the pressure of Massu, Salan declared Vive de Gaulle! from the balcony of the Algiers Government-General building on 15 May.\\\" - To the layman reader, again, this means absolutely nothing - an explanation is necessary.\\n\\nIn general, the section reads as if it's scrupulously avoiding the use of the words 'coup', 'rebellion', 'insurrection', or 'putsch', and refers to military actions/threats in a very circumspect manner. The most you get is the passage \\\"The crisis deepened as French paratroops from Algeria seized Corsica and a landing near Paris was discussed (Operation Resurrection).\\\" But it's completely unclear to the amateur reader what sort of landing, why that would deepen the crisis, etc. The necessary context is that the army junta had seized power in Algiers, demanded that de Gaulle lead a national government, and planned for a military seizure of Paris. But this is only hinted at or touched upon circumspectly in the course of the article. Other articles (e.g. the 1958 May Crisis one) don't suffer from this impediment and are more readable; I understand that political realities come up with editing articles of prominent figures sometime, but still, the section is essentially unreadable as is. Would it be possible for someone more knowledgeable than me to at least add more clarification to the section, or in the worst case, remove most of the section and direct people to the (much clearer) May 1958 Crisis page instead?

Of course a British point of view should be prominent; before the war de Gaulle was just a military man who had shown more bravery against the Nazis than most, but it was the British who made him, recognising him as the leader of the Free French and giving him succour and support.  Without the British, de Gaulle was nothing.  But whereas Adenauer and Schumann recognised that war was the curse of Europe and that a European union was the answer, It was de Gaulle's grandiose nationalism that, through his \\\"empty chair\\\" policy, nearly brought the EEC to a halt.  His veto of UK entry into the EEC was small-minded and not based on finer motives.  His fears of \\\"perfidious Albion's\\\" desire to filch French colonies proved groundless.

[[User:Rjensen|Rjensen]] ([[User talk:Rjensen|talk]]) 17:02, 9 February 2015 (UTC)\\n::::The sentence certainly belongs in the lead, as Britain and the USA were the dominant Allied powers and de Gaulle's often spiky relations with them were deliberate and an important part of the story of the war years: his policy of insisting that France still be treated as a Great Power in her own right. Churchill was indeed a proponent of de Gaulle in May and June 1940, when he had just taken office as Prime Minister. In his first months Churchill was keen to the point of self-delusion that France should carry on fighting. Later on relations soured (sinking the French fleet at Oran didn't help) and at one stage iirc de Gaulle even contemplated seeking sanctuary in the Soviet Embassy and transferring his allegiance to the USSR (at the end of 1944 he also made a mission to the USSR and signed a treaty with them, but again that was to ensure that France was treated as a great power in her own right). The Americans were very suspicious of de Gaulle, wrongly believing him to be a British puppet (wanting the European powers, even Britain, to give up their colonial empires was an important part of US policy at this time), and preferred to deal with Darlan and Giraud until de Gaulle squeezed the latter out by force of character. Britain only formally recognized de Gaulle's regime as the official government in exile as late as 1944, ''after'' the Americans had done so. Some writers have flagged this up as a classic example of Churchill's arguably excessive appeasement of the USA.[[User:Paulturtle|Paulturtle]] ([[User talk:Paulturtle|talk]]) 12:17, 19 August 2015 (UTC)\\n\\n== External links modified ==\\n\\nHello fellow Wikipedians,\\n\\nI have just added archive links to {{plural:3|one external link|3 external links}} on [[Charles de Gaulle]].

A Systematic Review of Women\\u2019s Motivations.\\\" by Megan H Bair-Merritt et al. It counts 35 studies saying that self-defense and retaliation as the primary motive, and 40 studies counting other motives as primary. So, I contend that the Wikipedia statement is not an accurate summary of the article's content and should be re-written.

Also, why was Strauss's statement that most female perpetrated IPV not in self-defense treated as his opinion, whereas sources reaching the \\nopposite conclusion were treated as fact? I guess what I am trying to ask is: why is this section written under the assumption that most female perpetrated IPV having different motives from male IPV the majority view, when it is so easy \\nto find reviews of the literature saying the opposite? Sewblon 17:54, 17 March 2018 (UTC)\\n\\n:Well, first...there was a grammatical issue. Look at the following: \\\"''She found that The most commonly reported IPV motives for both men and women are anger, reacting to a verbal or emotional insult, or to 'get through to' the partner.''\\\" Second, simply stating \\\"coercive control\\\" was enough. Well, that...and then explaining what coercive controls means and which sex uses it more. Third, [[Murray A. Straus]]'s research is based on the highly disputed gender symmetry viewpoint and the highly debated [[conflict tactics scale]]. So, yes, conclusions from his research often are not fact. Per [[WP:Due weight]], we give more weight to what the vast majority of reliable sources state. More sources agree with the self-defense aspect, at least in part, for women than with the \\\"not for self-defense at all\\\" conclusion. And the research didn't state anything. It's the researchers stating this. So \\\"suggests\\\" or \\\"indicates,\\\" which are terms we sometimes use for medical/health topics (and, yes, this is one), are more accurate when noting what the research shows. As for \\\"presented as fact,\\\" I prefer \\\"suggests\\\" and \\\"indicates\\\" for research unless the research is the majority viewpoint, is speaking of what the author(s) rather than what the research found, or unless the word \\\"found\\\" is clear that it is specifically about the study in question rather than about the topic as a whole. \\\"Found\\\" has a degree of \\\"this is a fact that applies to all or most cases\\\" authority to it that I avoid. Also, make sure that you have a grasp on what a [[literature review]] is. It's not the same as [[peer review]]. [[User:Flyer22 Reborn|Flyer22 Reborn]] ([[User talk:Flyer22 Reborn|talk]]) 19:14, 17 March 2018 (UTC)\\n\\n:If the statement has to do with gender symmetry, I definitely avoid \\\"found,\\\" per what I stated above about that area of research being heavily debated. [[User:Flyer22 Reborn|Flyer22 Reborn]] ([[User talk:Flyer22 Reborn|talk]]) 19:23, 17 March 2018 (UTC)\\n::1. \\\"[[Murray A. Straus]]'s research is based on the highly disputed gender symmetry viewpoint.\\\" Its not \\\"based\\\" on the gender-symmetry viewpoint. It supports the gender-symmetry viewpoint. The gender-symmetry conclusion comes from the research rather than the other way around. 2. \\\"highly disputed\\\" by whom? 3. \\\"highly debated [[conflict tactics scale]].\\\" Its true that the conflict tactics scale is has been criticized by other sociologists like [[Michael Kimmel]]. However, it is still the most frequently used research tool to study domestic violence. If you exclude research based on the CTS from your definition of \\\"fact\\\" then you are excluding at least a plurality of the peer-reviewed and published literature on the subject. That is necessarily going to skew your account. 4. \\\"we give more weight to what the vast majority of reliable sources state. More sources agree with the self-defense aspect, at least in part, for women than with the \\\"not for self-defense at all\\\" conclusion.\\\" That is not an accurate description of the dispute. The argument isn't \\\"no self-defense\\\" vs \\\"at least a little bit of self-defense.\\\" Its \\\"Who is more likely to use IPV in self-defense? Men, Women? or neither?\\\" As far as I know, No one has ever directly responded to Hamby and Straus's claim that men and women commit IPV in self-defense against each other at approximately equal rates. 5. \\\"Also, make sure that you have a grasp on what a [[literature review]] is. It's not the same as [[peer review]].\\\" Peer-review means that other academics have vetted the work in question for soundness. A literature review is a secondary source that summarizes empirical research done by other scientists. I was under the impression that the sources from Hamby and Straus were literature reviews in that sense.  <!-- Template:Unsigned --><small class=\\\"autosigned\\\">\\u2014&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Sewblon|Sewblon]] ([[User talk:Sewblon#top|talk]] \\u2022 [[Special:Contributions/Sewblon|contribs]]) 20:13, 17 March 2018 (UTC)</small> <!--Autosigned by SineBot--> Sewblon 20:21, 17 March 2018 (UTC)\\n:::Your first point is semantics. I stand by my statement that \\\"Straus's research is based on the highly disputed gender symmetry viewpoint.\\\" As for \\\"highly disputed by whom?\\\"...the literature. It's made clear in this article and in the [[Domestic violence against men]] article, via sources, that gender symmetry is a highly controversial/highly disputed area of research. Not focusing so much on what Straus states is not about excluding material. It's about following WP:Due weight. Have you read that policy? It's clear about giving more weight to the majority viewpoint. It's also clear that undue weight can be given in a variety of ways. The notion that women don't commit IPV for self-defense at all or only occasionally is indeed a minority viewpoint. And your edits are trying to make it seem like self-defense is not a primary motive or the main motive, despite the literature repeatedly and overwhelmingly supporting self-defense as at least one big motive for why women commit IPV. You stated \\\"''[the more sources agree with the self-defense aspect, at least in part, for women than with the 'not for self-defense at all' conclusion] is not an accurate description of the dispute. The argument isn't 'no self-defense' vs 'at least a little bit of self-defense.''\\\" And yet you added Straus stating that \\\"most IPV committed by women against men is not in self-defense.\\\" That statement is focused on \\\"a little bit of self-defense,\\\" in that it is stating that few women use self-defense, or that self-defense is only used occasionally by women, in these cases. You stated, \\\"''No one has ever directly responded to Hamby and Straus's claim that men and women commit IPV in self-defense against each other at approximately equal rates.''\\\" Without getting into everything that Hamby states, I'll note right now that no one needs to specifically challenge the claim that \\\"men and women commit IPV in self-defense against each other at approximately equal rates\\\" when the literature repeatedly supports self-defense as being one of the main reasons, or one of the suspected main reasons, that women commit IPV. There is debate on what women's primary motive is; self-defense is a big part of that debate. Self-defense as a motive is commonly reported for women while it is significantly less reported for men. There is no big debate on whether men's primary motive for IPV is self-defense, but that debate does exist for women. As for reviews, I was simply trying to make it clear since we have had editors confusing the matter and sometimes citing primary sources for their arguments. [[User:Flyer22 Reborn|Flyer22 Reborn]] ([[User talk:Flyer22 Reborn|talk]]) 21:11, 17 March 2018 (UTC)\\n\\n== Men ==\\n\\nThe final sentence of the section on men says the opposite of what the source's abstract says. Wikipedia: \\\"A consistent finding throughout the literature is that the majority of women arrested for IPV perpetration against male partners are victims using violence to resist and defend themselves against their batterers.\\\" The abstract says: \\\"Several explanations are posed in the literature that attempt to explain such a rise, including the hypothesis that women are being arrested not for offensive violence but rather for defensive violence. Few studies, however, have used empirical data to support such arguments.\\\" I am changing it unless someone else objects.

(Pulled in via [[WP:FRS]]) It is apparent to me the the October 3 version of the article seems to be more passive, which is my prefered outcome when references are weak. While I personally am adverse to fossil fuels and their extraction companies and generally hate them, Wikipedia is a encyclopedia and we can't go around being [[WP:NPOV]]. The references, as always with medical papers are trepidatious about making any grand statements.

At its current stage the second sentence makes statement that methane contamination is not caused by HF. If so, it raises question why in this case we need a three-paragraph subsection about something which is not caused by HF. [[User:Beagel|Beagel]] ([[User talk:Beagel|talk]]) 21:57, 1 November 2014 (UTC)\\n\\n:I also see that you have reverted a reference to a National Academy of Science paper called \\\"Methane contamination of drinking water accompanying gas-well drilling and '''hydraulic fracturing'''\\\" In view of the title, and the impeccable source could you please justify that removal? Again it is something that is in the public view, and is highly relevant. The clue is in the title of the paper. It seems that you are removing much of the editing that I have done. On what grounds might this be? There is no mention in this article about the fact that most of the EU and UK get water from water companies, and so will not suffer from this problem, which surely is relevant to any well drilled, for shale gas, LTO, traditional wells etc. If I were to put an edit that reflected that would you revert that, as 'original research', or not relevant to the discussion? Proving that methane is NOT related to HF is one of the points, yet by your logic Beagel, this whole section must be deleted. The trouble is that you need the evidence to show that it is irrelevant. In the US it is a massive debating issue, yet you seem to want to hide that data? Justification please, and comments from other editors please.  [[User:Kennywpara|Kennywpara]] ([[User talk:Kennywpara|talk]]) 09:17, 2 November 2014 (UTC)\\n\\n::The UN report says nothing about hydraulic fracturing. However, putting it into the article about hydraulic fracturing makes impression that its UN report's conclusion that water scarcity is not a problem for HF in Europe. However, it is not the conclusion of the report but your conclusion and therefore it is OR. It does not matter if the conclusion is correct or false (I personally believe that it is correct) but the thing is that we should not make conclusions based on the primary sources by ourselves. If you have a good source implicitly saying in which regions water scarcity is a problem for implementing HF and in which regions it is not, I am more than happy to have the information cited in this article. \\n\\n::About methane issue, as it has been said a numerous time HF is a not synonym for shale gas production and it is used also for other purposes. Therefore, comparison of emissions from cola-fired power plants and from shale gas life-cycle is highly relevant in articles about shale gas but not articles about hydraulic fracturing. [[User:Beagel|Beagel]] ([[User talk:Beagel|talk]]) 16:26, 2 November 2014 (UTC)\\n\\n\\nYou still have made no justification for the fine distinctions you are identifying. All shale gas wells involve HF. So do LTO, geothermal, and traditional frack wells. Why do you wish to separate them? To make it more difficult for the public to access the information? This article appears to be a one stop shop (much like I have tried to make the 'HF in the UK' page), The issues of methane etc are common to all of these, and some to traditional wells. The regulations for trad wells and unconventional are very similar, as the techniques and concerns are largely the same.\\n\\nBy the same logic,[[User:Beagel|Beagel]] this article contains loads of totally irrelevant information relating to HF. Air emissions, water consumption, Surface spills, methane, land usage, induced seismicity, noise pollution, safety issues, health risks, policy and science, should all be deleted from this article as they are nothing to do with HF. They should be put in an article about drilling impact. Shall I delete them all? [[User:Kennywpara|Kennywpara]] ([[User talk:Kennywpara|talk]]) 19:50, 2 November 2014 (UTC)\\n\\n:Not all shale gas is produced by using HF. Most of it yes but not all. As the HF is an important technique used for the unconventional gas production, it is not the only one and it is just a part of the whole production process. So, distinction is there and not just invented by me. As for water consumption, it is very directly related to the HF as one of the main components of this process. And if it causes contamination (air, surface water, groundwater etc) or other direct effects, it belongs here. At the same time, if the contamination or these effects are caused by other processes of unconventional hydrocarbons production, such as drilling, bad cementing etc, it should be removed from this article (and put in the more relevant article, if necessary). I agree that this article still needs a lot of work, but it can't be done by replacing text which quality is not in line with Wikipedia policies with different kind of text with the same (or different) problems.\\n\\n:I also advice to stop guessing my intentions. There is no secret, no hidden agenda. My only intention is to make these article encyclopedic, written encyclopedic way and following style and structure of Wikipedia. [[User:Beagel|Beagel]] ([[User talk:Beagel|talk]]) 20:57, 2 November 2014 (UTC)\\n\\n::''Not all shale gas is produced by using HF'' citation needed.''As for water consumption, it is very directly related to the HF as one of the main components of this process'' so what about other fracking methods?. Please see my 'Umbrellas' post in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Hydraulic_fracturing_in_the_United_Kingdom#Umbrellas as way of explanation. [[User:Kennywpara|Kennywpara]] ([[User talk:Kennywpara|talk]]) 18:05, 3 November 2014 (UTC)\\n:::Reference for what? As I said that majority of shale gas (maybe even 99%, I don't know) is produced by usinf HF, but there are still some exceptions, e.g. HF is not allowed and conventional drilling/horizontal drilling without HF is used instead of (e.g. in Denmark). There are also some other well stimulation methods other than HF. Most of them are not in commercial use, but at least pneumatic fracturing is used in the limited scale for stimulation of shallow shale formations.

I am happy you changed the tag, just as long as this gets sorted! What about this.\\n\\n''The potential risks associated with hydraulic fracturing include water contamination, noise pollution, air emissions, water consumption, well leaks, flaring, and long term health effects.''\\n\\n''There is also public concern over transport issues, development of the countryside, and climate change. \\n\\nThe potential risk effects in different countries are heavily dependant on the regulatory regime in force, local planning laws, and the chemicals permitted for hydraulic fracturing.''\\n\\n''Different regulatory approaches have thus emerged. In France and Vermont for instance, a precautionary approach has been favored and hydraulic fracturing has been banned.[19][20] Some countries such as the U.S. have adopted the approach of clearly identifying risks before regulating. In the UK, the regulatory framework is largely being shaped by a report commissioned by the UK Government in 2012, which found that the risks associated with hydraulic fracturing are manageable if carried out under effective regulation and if operational best practices are implemented.[15]''\\n\\nShort, sweet, and more importantly, leading you on to look further.

According to the [[WP:LEAD]] the lead should be able to stand alone as a concise overview. It should define the topic, establish context, explain why the topic is notable, and summarize the most important points, including any prominent controversies.  I think that these conditions are fulfilled. At the same time I agree with {{u|RockMagnetist}} that some trimming is needed. [[WP:LEAD]] does not define the length of the lead by a number of symbols but by a number of paragraphs. According to it, as a general guideline\\u2014but not absolute rule\\u2014the lead should usually be no longer than four paragraphs. As we have at the moment a number of very short paragraphs (some of them just one paragraph), the first step could be combining existing paragraphs. After that it could be trimmed by some of rewording (but not by replacing existing text with absolutely new one). After doing that I don't think the lead is too long, particularly taking account the overall size of this article.\\n::I strongly disagree with removing naming potential risks from the lead.  Potential does not mean they will happen but means they may happen if not avoided, mitigated etc. Leaving only different regulations in the lead is not sufficient and it violates different policies and guidelines, ''inter alia'' [[WP:LEAD]], [[WP:SS]] and [[WP:UNDUE]]. [[User:Beagel|Beagel]] ([[User talk:Beagel|talk]]) 19:41, 17 November 2014 (UTC)\\n\\n:::I also would disagree with removing potential risks from the lead, but they should be described as such, not as effects, one of my problems with this. Also theres repetition about noise that isnt needed. Water use is area specific, (not a problem in Europe or most of the US for instance. Industry and farming are much bigger problems.

[[User:Beagel|Beagel]] ([[User talk:Beagel|talk]]) 21:25, 17 November 2014 (UTC)\\n\\n:::::::Well its been there for ages and was really poor. Perhaps other editors can comment on where it as now. The first sentence is not encyclopaedic. Stating that there is an effect when there is a risk is not acceptable.)  seems to have reinstalled the rather redundant sentence on what is a minor issue for many, that of noise. In environmental risk assessments in the UK, this is rated as 'low impact' so why repeated references? I have left it in for now.\\n\\nI removed the sentence about the Oxford study, as it is in the main body, and is not highly relevant anyway in the EU, which is not an area that experiences drought. Water use by fracking is very small anywhere, in comparison to farming and industry.\\n\\nI reinstalled the phrase 'and are required to be non hazardous in their application' as this does seem to rather crucial and is highly relevant. I do not understand why this was removed. This is under developement by the EU,(which sets minimum standards) but the UK is ahead of that in regulation. The EU stuff on chemicals is still at the investigation stage, under JAGDAG, and will be released soon.\\n\\nI removed the sentence about contamination by old wells. This is only relevant in places like NE Pennsylvania, which is riddled with old wells, and with shallow frack wells so is hardly a general point. All UK and EU stuff is recommending minimum separations of at least 1000m. In the stated reference \\n\\\"The weight of evidence is that fracture propagation \\u2018 out of zone \\u2019 to shallow groundwater is unlikely from deep (1000m or 3000ft) shale gas reservoirs; however, this may not be true at shallower depths and consideration is needed of cross connections between wells, including abandoned wells, in neighbouring areas which could provide migratory pathways\\\" \\n\\nI added an EU link about the developing regime of regulations. This is is currently a recommendation, but if you look at http://ec.europa.eu/environment/integration/energy/unconventional_en.htmyou will see this is evolving. These principles are not optional. Again, its short, basic, and is crucial information. \\n\\nI do not understand why the last two paras are there. Its nothing to do with the environmental effects of HF. \\n\\nWill await other comments but please do not revert these until there has been discussion. If other editors are reluctant to come forward it may be that they do not wish to put their heads above the parapet. However, the intro as it started was unacceptable and not [[NPOV]] [[User:Kennywpara|Kennywpara]] ([[User talk:Kennywpara|talk]]) 10:41, 18 November 2014 (UTC)\\n\\n===Recent edit changes of the lead===\\nGood, we seem to be getting somewhere. Thankyou for working on my comments [[User:Beagel|Beagel]] ([[User talk:Beagel|talk]] Its better that way than to have an edit war. \\nI am very happy with 1,2,4, and 5. They are balanced, exclude meaningless words like 'secondary accidents' and identify risks, rather than describing them as effects, one of my major issues.\\n\\nNumber 3 is more problematic. \\nFirstly, all of the water use material seems accurate, but in the context of national production, the unit 'billions of metres cubed'(tonnes), is more appropriate, rather than gallons. The data that water to frack one well for 10 plus years is the same as a 1 GigaWatt coal power station (1 million homes) for 12 hours puts the amount in context. In non desert areas it is insignificant. 0.01% of nationally abstracted amount in the UK for example. Surely something like 'Water usage by fracking can be a problem in areas that experience water shortage' would cover it. This is an often repeated theme by people who are against fracking, yet it is not supported by science in most areas, as I keep saying, agriculture and industry are the big users. Fracking is minor. \\n\\nSecondly, for I think the second time, you have removed the comments about the EU or UK policy to the body of the article. This leaves the lead saying 'Surface water may be contaminated through spillage and improperly built and maintained waste pits,[10] and ground water can be contaminated if the fluid is able to escape'.\\nThis is not balanced. The EU does not allow open pits, and in view that it contains 28 sovereign countries,many of whom have been debating using HF for shale gas, this must appear in the lead. I believe this originates from the 2006 groundwater directive mentioned in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_fracturing_in_the_United_Kingdom#Chemicals_permitted_for_hydraulic_fracturing_in_the_UK \\nThe comments on making a Wiki lead say that it should contain a summary of the key points. That fundamentally is a key point! Anti frack literature is full of pictures of open and leaking pits, yet in these are forbidden in the EU. Its fundamentally dishonest, or ignorant of them to do that but they still do. Leaving the article as it is would foster that falsehood.\\nI will leave this for a day or so but I feel that the points I have raised above are crucial, and would give this article a balance, and a technical credibility it has been sorely missing. [[User:Kennywpara|Kennywpara]] ([[User talk:Kennywpara|talk]]) 17:03, 19 November 2014 (UTC) \\n\\nOh, and I just found this. Interesting re health effects, as shale gas could be replacing the infinitely more polluting coal. http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jun/12/european-coal-pollution-premature-deaths In fact, in places like Pennsylvania, health has improved, as gas has displaced coal. [[User:Kennywpara|Kennywpara]] ([[User talk:Kennywpara|talk]]) 17:06, 19 November 2014 (UTC)\\n\\n:Sorry I have taken so long to respond - real life intrudes. I don't have time to get into details, but I'll share some general observations. First, I think the lead is much improved, but could use some reorganization. The biggest concern, water pollution, should come first, followed by air pollution. Other less important issues like land use, noise and seismicity could be lumped together in a paragraph. And the paragraph on policy is too long and detailed. <span style=\\\"font-family:Comic Sans MS; color:grey;\\\">[[User:RockMagnetist|RockMagnetist]]([[User talk:RockMagnetist|talk]])</span> 17:09, 19 November 2014 (UTC)\\n\\n::re@{{u|RockMagnetist}}. Thank you for your comment. Please feel free to re-arrange these paragraphs. And I agree that the policy paragraph needs some trimming. We do not have to report these details inj the lead.\\n\\n::Agree on the policy issues at the end, esp as its not even about environmental issues....[[User:Kennywpara|Kennywpara]] ([[User talk:Kennywpara|talk]]) 20:43, 19 November 2014 (UTC)\\n\\n::re@{{u|Kennywpara}}. To answer your concerns:\\n::*''cubic meters versus gallons''. I fully agree that we should use the SI units, that means cubic meters. At the same time these sources has reported the amount in US gallons which is also common unit in the US. Therefore, as of now both units are provided by using {{tl|convert}} template.\\n\\n\\n::*''water to frack one well for 10 plus years is the same as a 1 GigaWatt coal power station (1 million homes) for 12 hours''. Please find a reliable source what says this and I am more than glad to see this in the article (in the relevant section, not in the lead). But we need a source saying this, not calculating ourselves as this accounts as [[WP:SYNTH]]. And that kind of details do not belong to the lead.\\n\\n:::Try page 20  of http://www.raeng.org.uk/publications/reports/shale-gas-extraction-in-the-uk [[User:Kennywpara|Kennywpara]] ([[User talk:Kennywpara|talk]]) 20:43, 19 November 2014 (UTC)\\n\\n::*''Water usage by fracking can be a problem in areas that experience water shortage''. It seems practical, but please use the official term 'hydraulic fracturing' instead of 'fracking' as was agreed for HF articles a quite long time ago \\n\\n::: No problem with that, this is the talk page after all! So one of us can change that then [[User:Kennywpara|Kennywpara]] ([[User talk:Kennywpara|talk]]) 20:43, 19 November 2014 (UTC)\\n\\n::*''Surface water may be contaminated through spillage and improperly built and maintained waste pits, and ground water can be contaminated if the fluid is able to escape''. This is balanced and summarise quite well the risk. Of course, there are different regulations but this does not change the nature of this risk.\\n Different regulations and practises, if appropriate, could be discussed in the relevant section but for the lead this is too detailed (particularly taking account the overall length of the lead). And I also disagree that this is the key point in the context of this article's lead. It should be a key point included in the lead for articles like [[Hydraulic fracturing waste water management regulations in the European Union]], but not for the general article dealing with all environmental impacts in more general level.\\n::[[User:Beagel|Beagel]] ([[User talk:Beagel|talk]]) 18:47, 19 November 2014 (UTC)\\n\\n::: The words 'pits' 'spillage' and 'improperly built' are not applicable in the EU and as such it cannot be balanced. Its sealed steel containers, on a chemical proof well pad, that has been flood assessed, and is well able to take spills without possibility of leaks. This for me is a big problem if this stays as it is as it misrepresents the science, thought and engineering that has gone into this to satisfy these concerns, raised because of the bad practice you have described.. I agree the risk of spills is a concern BUT this does not mention (or even refer to) the differences between the US (where this wording does apply) and the EU where these concerns have been mitigated. See pages 3 to 5 of https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/277211/Water.pdf (incidentally, DECC and the UK Govt use 'frack' a lot, as do other publications, but I am happy to use 'hydraulic fracturing') \\nThis could easily be sorted by adding the sentence. '''In the UK, regulations require that chemical proof pads and sealed steel containers are used to mitigate fluid and gas leaks risks''' with the appropriate link. Rememeber, the lead should stand on its own as a summary of the article. This is NOT a detail, its a fundamental point that is misunderstood by most. You have removed this 'detail' before.

The removal of this program progressed to arguments about Napster, an unsuccessful [[WP:WQA]], an indef block of one of the editors under [[WP:LEGAL]] (now retracted), and a lack of fun in general.

There is, as far as I know, no major academic work done on the subject of file sharing ethics. That article was pretty much entirely OR, except for the legal histories, which were mostly redundant with this article. The ethics section is trivial/nonexistent here, but some property rights are covered. We're not going to delete that article, to preserve its history, and there's no better place to redirect it to.

I suggest you try to find sources instead of removing text. This shouldn't be too hard. Just upon reading those paragraphs, I'm pretty sure you can use [[Steal This Film]] as source. I've only seen the second one myself. Another one would be [[Good Copy Bad Copy]].\\n:*[ftp://ftp.ulyssis.org/_old/other/GCBC/ download Good Copy Bad Copy]--[[User:Ondertitel|Ondertitel]] ([[User talk:Ondertitel|talk]]) 20:08, 3 April 2010 (UTC)\\n\\nThe unsourced weasel comments were tagged back at the beginning of Feburary 2010 by another editor and there has been no response.  Most of this section is poorly written.  \\n\\n--[[User:ArtemisChook|ArtemisChook]] ([[User talk:ArtemisChook|talk]]) 23:22, 3 April 2010 (UTC)\\n\\n:The paragraphs in question are not really questionable. I've heard all the arguments before. Therefor, in combination with the recent tagging, the text is just waiting to be referenced but this doesn't seem urgent. Hence the tagged invitation to add a reference to warn the reader that it could be questionable. Other articles with missing references often get a <nowiki>{{Refimprove|date=}}</nowiki>-tag at the top of the page/section. I could do add the references after a bit of searching, but for now there are other articles I want to dedicate my attention to (with these tags for years and no other so called \\\"experts\\\" on the topic -> thus I end up correcting mistakes and adding info so the article is more nuanced).\\n:I started to edit Wikipedia myself not so long ago and was attracted by these tags, because the info that was available in the article could not be found elsewhere on the Internet in the same format. Therefor I simply started by adding references to the article so it wouldn't get deleted. Later on I started adding information based on those sources I found and thus expanding articles. While [[Deletionism and inclusionism in Wikipedia|deletionists]] serve their purpose, I found your deletion a contraproductive move. Starting from sources to add content is the way to go. Try to source it, and while your at it, remove those weasel words and see if other sources refute it + reason why, so it becomes more nuanced. There are already enough people to remove content ;) For actual work however, each new person contributing is very appreciated! --[[User:Ondertitel|Ondertitel]] ([[User talk:Ondertitel|talk]]) 22:36, 4 April 2010 (UTC)\\n\\nrespectfully, I also have read all these arguments before and they ARE questionable and yes wiki articles do have tags to ask for citations to support claims but not one after the other like this section has with multiple weasel comments all in a row with nothing to substantiate the content!\\n\\n--[[User:ArtemisChook|ArtemisChook]] ([[User talk:ArtemisChook|talk]]) 05:35, 17 April 2010 (UTC)\\n\\n\\n== File Sharing prior to Internet Popularity and Shareware ==\\n\\nIt has been commented that shareware still exists, well BBS's still exist in one form or another but there is a distinction between formats of file sharing. Although shareware still exists in some form we need to focus on discussing history and the majority of file sharing at the time we are trying to reference. I vast majority of file sharing uses p2p methods. But in the early 90's a vast majority of the file sharing that did occur was between BBS's. FIDO, and WWIVnet being the two major networks of file sharers. Please discuss this point in history don't just attempt to remove it from the page as this form of computer networking is just as valid as the Internet and not deserves to be recorded for historical posterity. [[User:Deathmolor|Deathmolor]] ([[User talk:Deathmolor|talk]]) 13:34, 31 July 2010 (UTC)\\n\\n:Sorry, but there are several problems with your good faith edit and there is nothing \\\"inappropriate\\\" about an undo. OTOH, as I understand it, it is inappropriate to repost without discussion. \\n\\n:1. I mentioned the major problem [[WP:OR]] im my undo. \\n:2. There are currently over 700 web shareware sites. They have not disappeared. These are NOT p2p sites.\\n:3. Do you have a reference that the \\\"vast majority of file sharing uses p2p methods?\\\" This may be true of illegal file sharing.\\n:4. In the 90s, I would guess the majority of file-sharing was on Compuserve, AOL, and newsgroups as well as the web. \\n:5. Doom was released on newsgroups, a part of the Internet.\\n[[User:Objective3000|Objective3000]] ([[User talk:Objective3000|talk]]) 15:01, 31 July 2010 (UTC)\\n:: shareware is only one aspect of bbs's all sorts of file sharing happened either way this is all file sharing. File sharing is not confined to just p2p either way bbs's were p2p. I think your not looking deeply into this and have a perspective with no in site and the undo's are of no value informational wise to wiki. I think  we are at an impasse you refuse to contribute and I refuse to allow you to remove other peoples contributions. You will need to settle this as your angle requires no effort where mine is from a stand point of considerable knowledge and effort. [[User:Deathmolor|Deathmolor]] ([[User talk:Deathmolor|talk]]) 15:59, 7 August 2010 (UTC)\\n\\n:::1. Your comment that I \\\"refuse to contribute\\\" is a violation of [[WP:CIV]]. Please be civil and assume good faith.\\n:::2. I'm afraid I don't understand what you mean by \\\"perspective with no in site\\\" and \\\"File sharing is not confined to just p2p either way bbs's were p2p.\\\"\\n:::3. Your statement that you have \\\"considerable knowledge\\\" is irrelevant. WP edits are based on reliable references, not personal knowledge. [[WP:OR]]. Just as irrelevant is that I started in the IT communications field 42 years ago, and was an early BBS moderator during the ARPANET days. I don't use that as a basis for editing, because it isn't a basis.\\n:::4. There is no consensus at this point. Please stop posting your edit until there is a consensus.[[User:Objective3000|Objective3000]] ([[User talk:Objective3000|talk]]) 16:22, 7 August 2010 (UTC)\\n\\n:::: Please stop posting things in point form. You have yet to make a point which is not instantly devolved by even a minor examination of the facts, I think defaulting to remove of a contribution of facts in the matter is a form of vandalism i am sure you will at this point throw around some WP's to support your side but your doing nothing but war editing which I find happens a lot in the wiki population and yes i was there too 40 years ago so lets just be civil and could you actually make a point which is not instantly dissolved by the facts. If you would like to make an edit to my contribution by all means but removal is inappropriate the way i see it. Please stop removing until a consensus is made. Keep in mind the burden of proof is on you now since i have used references within wiki that have many references in them. Much of that section has also been written by me and revised by others but I intend to followup with any particular recommendations you have besides a undo. [[User:Deathmolor|Deathmolor]] ([[User talk:Deathmolor|talk]]) 01:43, 9 August 2010 (UTC)\\n::::: Point 1. Irrelevant \\\"im my undo\\\" i will require english translation to that to answer it. Major problem with the Undo is obvious. You are removing a contribution with little to no valid reason. this is not vandalism and is a good faith contribution. If you want me to read [WP:OR]] and use the lingo i will but i am hoping you will use your mind and infer from what i have said. All the other points you made only reference my discussion not the issues with the article. If you have issues with the article then please post your issues with the article and don't use point form, use proper sentence structure. I refuse to have you take less effort to describe your point of view. You are taking the easy way out of editing. I would like you conjugate your opinion of the edit i made to the article and what your reasons are to undo the whole thing and not edit it to comply by your version of the facts. [[User:Deathmolor|Deathmolor]] ([[User talk:Deathmolor|talk]]) 01:55, 9 August 2010 (UTC)\\n\\n::::::OK, now you are trying to add refs. That\\u2019s progress. But, you are not supposed to add text back to the article until consensus has been reached. A few points:\\n::::::1. I do not see where the ref on the \\u2018Net makes your point. The Internet was certainly as available as BBSs in the 90s and in fact in far wider use in homes.\\n::::::2. I\\u2019m afraid the www.pctips3000.com/file-sharing-history ref doesn\\u2019t make [[WP:RS]]. It\\u2019s a chatty, blog entry with no refs.\\n::::::3. The two discussions on sysops have problems with both [[WP:OR]] and [[WP:V]]. I don\\u2019t understand your reluctance to follow these links and read the descriptions. Doom was released on UseNet, a part of the Internet. The government and universities paid for the telecommunications at that time, not sysops.\\n::::::4.  As I said, there are still over 700 Shareware sites. I don\\u2019t see where your ref says Shareware has largely disappeared.\\n::::::I am not engaging in vandalism as you accuse and I do not understand your demand that I not logically separate my points. Please respond to my points instead of attacking me and wait for a consensus before reposting.[[User:Objective3000|Objective3000]] ([[User talk:Objective3000|talk]]) 11:42, 9 August 2010 (UTC)\\n::::::I have requested a third opinion.[[User:Objective3000|Objective3000]] ([[User talk:Objective3000|talk]]) 12:03, 9 August 2010 (UTC)\\n::::::: Your points which you continue to do in point form have no barring on the article whatsoever. From my perspective you are not to remove the contribution until their is a consensus. Why must it always be the person putting forward the least effort who decides to which point there is a stay until consensus. I say it stays until you have a valid reason for removal. You are not reading the articles referenced and using points which are not contained within the text. You really are not reading them or taking whatever small amount of text you can to support the removal and not focusing. further more no progress would be made if i did not continue to remove your undo. How would you even know there are new references if it were not for that? i think you are blatantly being unreasonable and progress can be made in the article if we continue to contribute to the facts present. You just continue to remove and not contribute. How about doing some research to refute or support, do something you so far are doing nothing and 700 shareware sites is not an argument, that says nothing. There are 10,000 bbs's and 20,000 ants within 100 foot radius. No point is being made. As for Dooms distribution Usenet was not available to general population if you read the first reference it goes into detail that the Internet was not available to the general public. Furthermore in the reference regarding the history shareware by the person who made shareware that it attributes the popularity of shareware to a growing Sysop movement of local BBS operators. Right now you are just trying to support your undo with no regard to trying to preserve the facts for posterity within WIKI as a whole. Really read the references take the time to do your research as I have. I cannot support your request to stay the submission until consensus as you are the only editor involved and are not supporting your stance whatsoever. There is no basis to seek consensus other then to delay the submission. [[User:Deathmolor|Deathmolor]] ([[User talk:Deathmolor|talk]]) 12:19, 9 August 2010 (UTC)\\n:::::::: Of course since your trying to support an invalid point that shareware is still alive, the organization that created it changed it name, One of the previous articles posted as reference covered the history of shareware and if you took the time to read it fully you would have seen the distribution model has ended as a viable model. The last article i posted which has quotes from every single major player in the shareware movement's past and  basically out and saying it is over will likely not convince you either. I will not pollute the article any further to service your very ridged execution of wiki rules. You are asking for far more strict proof and consensus then 90% of the articles in wiki but i am willing to oblige over and over again with so many facts it ruins the readability of the article if you wish but I would hope sanity will prevail and you will drop this rather obvious power struggle. I will summarize the last article for you since you have trouble with that. It comes down to the fact the name of the Association has changed because shareware as it was known is gone. The internet is an exercise in shareware already and trial software is available from everyone now. The concept as grown to become all encompassing and thus no longer exists in its original form. \\n\\n::::::::: \\\"The Shareware Industry Conference changed its name to the Software Industry Conference in 2007. Twenty plus years ago, when many (most?) PC users were still hackers, the term \\u201cShareware\\u201d had wide spread recognition. Although, even then, there was some confusion between shareware, freeware, crippleware etc. Nowadays, the term is nebulous at best, and very misleading. It\\u2019s mainly used to describe \\u201ceverything one can download from the Internet\\u201d (as an aside, a very useful experiment would be to ask 100 teenagers and 100 business people what they think of when they hear the world shareware).\\\" - Paris Karahalios, SIAF co-founder, Software Industry Conference board member and co-founder of Trius Inc. Although you can profess that the distribution model still exists in various forms on the Internet the reality is those who framed the term, coined it and marketed the model have decided to abandon the term. [[User:Deathmolor|Deathmolor]] ([[User talk:Deathmolor|talk]]) 13:03, 9 August 2010 (UTC)\\n\\n::::::::::Attacking me has no purpose. You made an edit that I believe violated two of the three pillars stated at the top of this page. No original research and verifiability. I removed the edit until consensus can be reached. Seriously, what is the hurry? Simply reach consensus on the text here, and THEN make the edit. You can post proposed text on this page and we can work with it.\\n\\n::::::::::At WP, we assume good faith. Saying that I am vandalizing, refusing to read refs, refuse to put in effort, refuse to contribute, am doing nothing, have no insight, have no regard for facts, etc., do not contribute to resolution. I also wish that you would take the time to read [[WP:OR]], [[WP:V]], [[WP:RS]], and [[WP:CIV]]. I don\\u2019t understand your stated reluctance to read WP guidelines. They are here to help us with disputes such as this. They really are brilliantly written.\\n\\n::::::::::Perhaps if you could explain what point you are attempting to add, we can come to some agreement. But, for now, all I see is unsubstantiated claims that the Internet was not in common use in the 90s (it was used more than non-Internet BBSs), Doom was not released on the Internet (it was released on USENET, which is a part of the Internet) and that Shareware is gone. I have asked for a third opinion in the hopes this will help us. I could have escalated, but chose this course as you appear unfamiliar with Wiki rules.

Since there is now supporting references I see no need to further delay the article since the primary reason for the removal in your own words is the lack of references It would seem a consensus has been met. I provided references and satisfied your argument now you wish to carry over the original objection to include the references. This would seem personal in motivation. [[User:Deathmolor|Deathmolor]] ([[User talk:Deathmolor|talk]]) 15:32, 9 August 2010 (UTC)\\n\\n::::::::::::Please look up the meaning of the word consensus. One editor cannot reach consensus.

You still have not addressed the issues.15:41, 9 August 2010 (UTC)\\n::::::::::::: You still have yet to support your argument and I find now that the constant reference to a personal attack is indeed a personal attack. We are at an impass you are doing the very thing you accuse me of. I am not attacking you but you are now professing that I am as some form of attack. You are in violation of [[WP:CIV]], you also did not properly sign your statement this time [[User:Deathmolor|Deathmolor]] ([[User talk:Deathmolor|talk]]) 15:52, 9 August 2010 (UTC)\\n\\n::::::::::::::YES, we are at an impasse. By definition, that means there is NO consensus. That is why I asked for a third opinion. Your dates are incorrect. Shareware has not disappeared. Doom was released on USENET, part of the Internet, not a BBS. Your refs do not support your statements. You have not responded to any of these. You just keep adding disputed text without consensus.[[User:Objective3000|Objective3000]] ([[User talk:Objective3000|talk]]) 16:01, 9 August 2010 (UTC)\\n:::::::::::::::My references are those of the Shareware Industry Conference in their own words. There is no better references in this field. Absolutely none, so your objection is misplaced and not objective as your name implies. Doom was released into Shareware this does not omit its distribution on USENET, These things are not mutually exclusive, but specifically inclusive if you take the time to read the reference material. If you read the historical reference provided by the ISOC organization it will specifically outline a decision to define the Internet and it was not framed until 1995, furthermore it was deregulated and privatized the same year allowing for local ISP distribution. So to say the Internet is a distribution model is a little over stated, the ISOC defines it as a protocol. Shareware was the distribution model and USENET was merely the protocol used to conduct it. Now to the specific discussion it was BBS's that were used to distribute files at the time, BBS networks, and the BBS's acted as the distribution points to local users for download. Many users with University or corporate access would download the files via USENET and then further distribute the shareware to local BBS's. This is also described in the supporting material.

You state \\u201cBetween 1979 and 1999 computers of course did not disappear nor did file sharing, the Internet had not taken a foothold yet and was not available to the regular home user.\\u201d The Internet was just as available to the home user before 1999 as were BBSs. Your refs do not support your words.\\n\\n::::::::::::::::You state \\u201cBasically networks of [[sysops]] would make nightly calls to share files and message board information.\\u201d I am certain that this occurred to some small degree. But, it was not the bulk of file-sharing prior to 1999. AOL, Compuserve, USENET all existed long before 1999 and included massive file sharing. File sharing was also abundant on time-sharing systems going back decades. Your characterization of pre-1999 file sharing as a group of independent BBS sysops paying for their own phone lines is simply not accurate and not supported by your refs. \\n\\n::::::::::::::::Doom was released on USENET. USENET was/is not a group of independent sysops paying their own telecom costs. Costs were originally funded primarily by TUCC. Again, your characterization is incorrect and not supported by your refs.\\n\\n::::::::::::::::Shareware, in its heyday, was not primarily distributed by independent sysops paying their own costs. AOL, Compuserve, USENET and the Web compromise the bulk of shareware distribution. And it simply makes no sense to say that Shareware has disappeared when there are over 700 Shareware sites.

He continued to make numerous edits to the section while the section was in dispute declaring that consensus was reached, when clearly there was no consensus. He continued to argue with personal statements about the editor here and on my Talk page instead of discussing the subject at hand. My numerous attempts to nudge him into collaboration were met by disdain for Wikipedia rules. I apologize if this was not the correct procedure, but could simply find no way to get him to discuss my points.

I find that this is more of restating what was said there but this section deserves a mention. There is a hole in file sharing section and the hole is there because of BBSing is being ignored. This era in history deserves more. The Internet was not as accessible back then as people seem to think, for instance in my area of the world there was no way to get Internet access other then going to University.

In the 70s, when the CIA turned ARPA over to the DoD and it was renamed DARPA, the DoD looked at ARPANet and decided that it had been co-opted by university researchers and in its polluted state was no longer of any use to the Pentagon. They put out a letter to the sites housing the nodes that gov\\u2019t funding would be halted and that they would have to self-fund if they wanted the backbone to continue. The expenses were quite high. The nodes were small Honeywell computers, a bit larger than a PDP-8. But, leased lines and high-speed digital \\u201cmodems\\u201d were extraordinarily expensive. A digital modem (pardon the oxymoron) for one of the lower-speed links (56Kb if I remember correctly) was five feet tall. The universities rebelled and convinced the gov\\u2019t to continue funding for the ARPANet backbone. Without this action in the early 70s, there might not be an Internet.

It would have happened just not as fast as it did. The hobbyists did feel alone and segregated from the people who had access to academic technology in most countries.

Not a major issue. But we are then informed that \\\"many of these reports\\\" have been criticised, followed by a vague ''New York Times'' opinion piece (published in 2004). The article argues convincingly that not every free download equals a lost sale. However, this is irrelevant because the studies above apply lower substitution rates, ranging from ten to forty-five percent (one in every ten downloads is a lost sale). The Oberholzer-Strumpf paper is good but it's already covered in the section immediately below. Nor do we need seven citations to buttress a statement that is uncontested when one reliable secondary source will suffice. Most importantly, this section does ''nothing'' to improve our understanding of the effects of file sharing. Much better to only describe what academics and independent economists have to say.  \\u2014 [[User:ThePowerofX|ThePowerofX]] 20:38, 16 February 2012 (UTC)\\n\\n: About wording - please feel free to fix it and adjust the references, they're clearly very far from being perfect.

The whole line of argument \\\"this section does ''nothing'' to improve our understanding of the effects of file sharing\\\" is fundamentally flawed, essentially arguing ''truth'' opposed to ''verifiability'' (same as argument that \\\"Oberholzer-Strumpf paper is good\\\" - as Wikipedia editors, we are not allowed to judge what is \\\"good\\\" and what is \\\"bad\\\", we're only allowed to look for published opinions and balance them proportionally to coverage they've obtained (and ''not'' by our judgement it is ''good'' or ''bad'')).

High quality sources are required and academic papers by independent researchers are most welcome. That is how Wikipedia expects us to proceed. Let us describe the ''real'' effects of file sharing using the most reliable sources. Anything else is a distraction.

The 2005 research is disputed by a post on pro filesharing blog Ars Technica and the ZDNet page that describes the study has expired but you are so determined to criticise the MPAA we must delve into the [[Internet archive]] to retrieve the original article. The only expressed criticism found in the more recent BBC story is directed toward the [[Digital Economy Bill]]. Campaigners were worried the British Government would use the 2010 study to justify [[Graduated response|Internet blocking]]. The methodology isn't faulted anywhere in the article. These are grouped together in a less-than-clear manner leaving the reader to discern some tangible connection (presumably ''all'' industry-backed research is baloney, so pay no attention). Please remember that we are meant to be ''describing'' the effects of file sharing. If the general consensus (i.e. reliable secondary sources) is that industry backed reports are least reliable, then let's include a sentence or quotation to that regard.

It acknowledges that digital piracy is rampant and notes that most economic studies conclude downloading decreases sales, but adds there are major \\\"cultural\\\" benefits -- such as downloaders listening to more music, regularly attending concerts, etc. -- and the price of doing something about it is not cost effective. Besides, if most studies say illicit downloading is bad for copyright owners, our article should reflect that.  \\u2014 [[User:ThePowerofX|ThePowerofX]] 22:39, 16 March 2012 (UTC)\\n\\n=== George R.Barker study ===\\n\\nIt seems that the section on file sharing is currently weighted towards the negative, based largely on a study by Dr. George Barker and an article summarising some recent papers written by Glenn Peoples.  The question is whether the weight is proportionate or not.  Regarding the following paragraph:\\n\\\"In total, 75% of P2P downloaders responded that if P2P were not available they would have purchased either through paid sites only (9%), CDs only (17%) or through CDs and pay sites (49%). Only 25% of people say they would not have bought the music if it were not available on P2P for free. This clearly suggests P2P network availability is reducing music demand of 75% of music downloaders which is quite contrary to Andersen and Frenz's much published claim.\\\"\\nI don't think the \\\"reducing music demand\\\" conclusion definitely follows.  It certainly follows that some music which is downloaded/shared illegally would otherwise have been purchased, but file-sharing also increases consumer exposure to products and brands, which can lead to people buying related products that they wouldn't otherwise have considered.  Having read through the paper, this \\\"increased exposure\\\" factor has been entirely ignored, and while it may not be enough to offset the lost sales from the genuine \\\"getting X for free instead of buying\\\", it isn't quite as clear-cut as Barker's study makes out.\\nSome alternative points were written here:\\nhttp://www.zeropaid.com/news/92723/cria-trying-to-debunk-industry-canadas-pro-p2p-study/\\n\\nIt remains to be seen what sort of scientific studies the Industry-Canada group and others will come out with to attempt to debunk what these above studies have been saying.  The way the current Wikipedia article is worded comes across to me as saying that those claiming that file-sharing has a significant negative impact on sales have essentially won the argument, but since this spate of studies is very recent, I'm not convinced that it will be shown to represent the last word with time. [[User:Tws45|Tws45]] ([[User talk:Tws45|talk]]) 22:16, 23 May 2012 (UTC)\\n\\n:The ANU College of Law paper (by Dr George Barker) makes no assessment of the scholarly literature, one way or the other, and it's misleading to imply this study is connected to, or commissioned by, the Canadian Record Industry Association, as the ZeroPiad blog does, when the research is independent. The reason why this article says 'most academic studies conclude filesharing has a negative effect on sales' is because that is what high quality sources say. Both Oberholzer and Strumpf\\u2015who maintain loses are not as large as industry groups claim\\u2015agree that most studies find piracy has a negative effect on sales.

And in many countries around the world we are  persecuted ... and murdered because we ''<u>are</u>'' lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. (Lesbians are targets of [[corrective rape]] because they're not viewed as \\\"normal\\\" by those who hunt them. Gay men are still [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/01/world/europe/chechen-authorities-arresting-and-killing-gay-men-russian-paper-says.html  murdered] for being gay. Transgender women and men are [https://www.autostraddle.com/2017-trans-women-murdered-385295/  not safe] anywhere.) So, I'm on the side that supports pointing out when an L/G/B/T character is included in a series and when a series includes LGBT characters, because they're not included in ''every'' series. And many series are broadcast internationally and watched by viewers from around the world, and those viewers often want to learn more about what they've seen in the series. Labels = visibility.

So what we're left with is a show that actually comes from the new era in which LGBT characters are ''not'' bit players and one-off jokes, but essentially treats its LGBT characters this way anyway. Again, this is all OR, but the secondary sources that have been cited seem to by-and-large agree.

Yara's love for women was an afterthought thrown in in season six (it was not alluded to at any point before this, and does not apparently come from the books) and was apparently there only for her to make a jab at her brother (which could have been meant to be played for laughs or not -- I honestly read Yara's lines as being meant to be humorous, even if Theon's reaction was not), and was followed up by a similar scene the following season. Anyway, I did not mean to imply that I thought Oberyn \\\"was heterosexual\\\" or anything of the sort; I merely meant to use the word to mean \\\"of the opposite sex (from Ellaria)\\\" -- in the show at least, Ellaria's defining characteristic is her love for Oberyn and desire to avenge his death, and it would be really easy for a casual viewer who wasn't looking for LGBT themes in the show to simply forget that she and Oberyn weren't simply two heterosexual characters. (And yes, all of these characters are extremely minor in the show overall -- the above joke-y exchange between Doran and Ellaria ended with Ellaria killing Doran in a clumsy attempt to sweep the entire Dornish storyline under the rug because it had been poorly received; she and the Sand Snakes having only a few more brief appearances before themselves being killed off was obviously another result of this.)</s> [[User:Hijiri88|Hijiri 88]] (<small>[[User talk:Hijiri88|\\u8056]][[Special:Contributions/Hijiri88|\\u3084\\u3084]]</small>) 01:38, 13 January 2018 (UTC)\\n::::<s>I'd also like it noted that I feel really, ''really'' uncomfortable with any insinuation that I am making common cause with ''Game of Thrones'' fan-boys who are arguing against \\\"SJW\\\" editors trying to PC-ify this and other popular culture articles.

As I understand it describes what sort of articles are included in the category, and I know of no other description. It works for both readers, to help find the things they're looking for, and editors, to decide whether an article fits the bill. Unless you wish to rewrite it, then go through the list to see if all the articles meet your new criteria, I suggest we stick to using it as it's written/intended. And when you wrote, \\\"Quoting it in the RFC question is going to bias future responses\\\", correct me if I'm wrong but it sounds like you think people will start voting the other way. Your labelling of that as 'bias', when all I did was quote the guidelines (or whatever the term is), sounds like you don't want people to apply the actual criteria.\\n:This should really have been an open and shut case. Along with the criteria shown above the question should be, as always, are there reliable secondary sources to back it up? If the answer is yes you add it to the category, if not you don't.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoxmrRAW-SA I was ... delayed.] Anyway, I have serious questions about whether the \\\"LGBT-related\\\" category should even exist if it has the kind of clumsy inclusion criteria you quote. The fact that there is no [[:Category:American LGBT-themed television shows]], and that the only LGBT categories in which ''[[Will & Grace]]'' and similar shows are included all use the same \\\"related\\\" language, implies to me that [[:Category:American LGBT-related television shows]] is actually meant to be for shows where LGBT themes are prominent enough to be mentioned somewhere in the body of the main article. (If we don't have distinct categories for shows that definitely are LGBT-themed, then using the \\\"LGBT-related\\\" categories to smash LGBT-themed shows in with shows like this that happen to include some mostly very minor characters whom some fans would like to think are gay would be inappropriate -- where do we go to find shows that are actually LGBT-themed?) In this case, however, even the supposedly LGBT ''characters'' (who, again, have been inconsistently portrayed throughout the show's history) are all so minor as not to be mentioned anywhere in the article -- Oberyn, Yara, Loras and Renly are not, Ellaria probably shouldn't be given how she had only a few cameo appearances in seasons five and six, and was quickly killed off in season seven, and Varys is not LGBT. Again, we must question how \\\"reliable\\\" the \\\"secondary sources\\\" you are referring to are when they get details like these so very wrong, and even those that do get the details right and probably are reliable all seem to conveniently fail to define ''GOT'' as an LGBT-related show.

Asha Greyjoy, renamed Yara, is portrayed as lesbian in the series (I'll buy her being pansexual when she's shown with women, men, androgynes, CDs, and TSs). In the novels and series, the people of Dorne tolerate same-sex lovers and relationships. Daenerys is bisexual in the novels, but not yet portrayed the same on tv.

In particular for tv series and movies there are a lot of \\\"low quality\\\" secondary sources which can misread/misunderstood. I've seen plot descriptions for movies assembled from secondary sources which were completely off. Not just by matter of nuances or personal emphasis or preference but off as in describing a basic plot that simply doesn't exist in the movie. This is due misreading secondary sources and not being aware of that due to not having seen the movie. For instance the description in a \\\"low quality\\\" secondary source can be sloppy and/or imprecise.

The simple fact is that the show is inconsistent and clumsy when it comes to characters' sexuality: Yara's being bisexual was never stated directly (and was apparently shoehorned in so that she could have a lesbian kiss in the latest season; and perhaps as an apology for at least one bisexual character having previously had that aspect of her character expunged), and the other characters you listed mostly either had their being bisexual mentioned in an off-handed joke that they don't care which gender prostitute they pay for or some such or had a sexual orientation that played no role in the plot whatsoever because they themselves were very minor characters. Renly and Loras were boh portrayed as unambiguously gay, but it was only obvious in a throwaway filler scene (it was literally invented to give the actors more screentime, and was not in the books, where their sexuality played ''no'' role in the story, to the point where only very close readers were even aware that they were gay; and Renly was a very minor character who killed off almost immediately ''anyway''.

Taking 29 years to coin a term hardly qualifies as 'a response', neither is citing the 'Armenian Genocide' as an example, the same as coining the term as 'a response' I know the sources refer to attempts by Lemkin to get 'crimes against groups',  recognised before 1944, but if no published use of the term existed before 1944, the term simply did not exist before then. \\n\\nAnother source used states explicitly \\\"in the course of his monumental study ''Axis Rule in Occupied Europe,'' the late Raphael Lemkin coined the word genocide - from the Greek genos (race or tribe) and the Latin cide (killing) - to describe the deliberate ''destruction of a nation or of an ethnic group.'' The concept was catching, and in December 1946 the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted a resolution recognizing genocide as a ''crime under international law'' \\u2026 \\u2026 ''Axis Rule in Occupied Europe'' doesn't sound much like 'the Armenian Genocide'!

No, the ''Axis Rule'' was certainly not the recognition of the term on the strength of a genocide which took place over 20 years earlier.

'Armenia' is an example of the newly coined term, one of a number I believe in his book, but the term was not coined as 'a response' to Armenia. Unless there were an absolutely unequivocal statement from Lemkin that it was such a response, we have to go with what 2ndary sources are saying, which is that it was an example.\\n\\n:::I'm prepared to try and make the edit, however what I'm a bit unsure of at present is where Nazi racial policies in occupied Europe, and specifically the holocaust fit into the 'coinage' narrative, ''(ie were these the primary subject of Lemkin's book, which the book title suggests, were they also examples, if not how did they fit into Lemkin's account?)''.

Sources do not state that Lemkin 'coined the term in response' to any single event, and you can't equate Lemkin's use of 'Nazi war crimes in Europe' with the Holocaust, since he is referring to many war crimes OTHER than even the broader use of 'Holocaust' ''(ie including Roma etc)''. Lemkin is clear that what was being done to the Jews and to Poles, Russians and other E. Europeans was more brutal than what was happening in W. Europe, but the book is about ALL 'crimes against peoples' in occupied Europe and the term was coined in a book about those crimes. Lemkin did become interested in the subject initially because of hearing about Armenia, and he does cite Armenia ''(and several other examples)'' as 'classic examples' but he coined the term nearly twenty years after first becoming interested in what happened in Armenia and in a different context. Let's find a way to represent all this clearly and succinctly.

I can't access his autobiography through my University but it's supposedly on page 19-20. When Lemkin coined it the full scale of the [[Holocaust]] was not yet common knowledge, but he was obviously already drawing parellels. Example from [https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10008187 United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]: \\\"The origin of the term ''genocide'' and its codification in international law have their roots in the mass murder of Armenians in 1915\\u201316. Lawyer Raphael Lemkin, the coiner of the word and later its champion at the United Nations, repeatedly stated that early exposure to newspaper stories about Ottoman crimes against Armenians was key to his beliefs about the need for legal protection of groups (a core element in the UN Genocide Convention of 1948).\\\" [[User:Prinsgezinde|Bataaf van Oranje (Prinsgezinde)]] ([[User talk:Prinsgezinde|talk]]) 10:39, 10 April 2017 (UTC)\\n\\nI think it is widely recognised that Lemkin's interest in the subject of 'crimes against peoples' was first aroused by various  incidents, notably Armenia. But the term was not coined in respomse to that event. nor any single event, but the context of coinage is 'WWII crimes' ''(and not specifically those against Jews, nor against E Europe)''. \\n\\nThere are several 'historical' ''(ie pre-WWII)'' examples given in Lemkin's book, inc Armenia and various C19th pogroms. Many WP articles, on the basis of being given by Lemkin as examples, claimed to be the origin of the term. I'm afraid NONE of them are.

[[User:Seraphim System|Seraphim System]] ([[User talk:Seraphim System|talk]]) 22:46, 10 April 2017 (UTC)\\n:::Lemkin did not invent genocide, he coined a new term for already existing acts. An act of genocide would have been a crime under existing laws before the term genocide was coined and defined as a crime. For example, it was the opinion of the Permanent Peoples' Tribunal in its examination of the Armenian Genocide that the 1948 International Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide was formally expressing an already existing prohibition. So I think that the term \\\"genocide\\\" can, if sourced, be reasonably applied to all modern-era (mid to late 19th century and onward) acts of genocide (because the acts would have been prohibited by existing laws). Further back than that and any assertions of genocide would require much stronger sourcing, not just one-off claims by lobbyists or activists.

The ECHR held universal jurisdiction for the crime genocide, which means any national court can try some for a genocide that was committed outside its territory. It also upheld the broad definition of genocide, in other words, under the ECHR ruling biological-physical destruction is ''not'' required. The work of legal scholars should be cited directly to them, or to a general source like Oxford Handbooks, and not represented as part of the Court's holding about an element of a crime (see [[Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Legal#Guidelines|WP:MOSLAW]]) [[User:Seraphim System|<span style=\\\"font-family:Candara; color:#cc00cc; text-shadow:#b3b3cc 0.2em 0.2em 0.4em;\\\">'''Seraphim System'''</span>]] <sup>([[User talk:Seraphim System|<span style=\\\"color:#009900\\\">talk]])</span></sup> 18:27, 17 April 2017 (UTC)\\n:::???What has this to do with this RfC or my above point?

Why would restoring the 'hatnote' be synonymous with treating the subject as though it were solely-legal, this appears to be a false argument used to try to radically alter ''(and in this case probably distort)'' an article subject. What on earth has Jorgic got to do with the ostensible subject of the RfC, ie the \\\"hatnote\\\".

If it is understood that a [[MOS:LAW]] compliant article should be written explicitly covering the subject of 'genocide' in criminal law, it's a separate question. The subject of this article is, however, 'Genocide', not [[:Genocide (law)]].

Firstly, you're not going to find experts in the field who are prepared to develop the article. Really.

Srebrenica is a controversial event, but massacres are never genocide because massacre and genocide have two different definitions,.\\n\\nGenocide is systematic and widespread over a large area. Massacre is an event that takes place within a single area. This is not genocide denial at all.  I feel that the whole genocide denial thing is completely ridiculous on Srebrenica, as other sources not listed on here, contradict the official story found by independent investigators from many countries on the Srebrenica case.  <span style=\\\"font-size: smaller;\\\" class=\\\"autosigned\\\">\\u2014 Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/108.11.158.220|108.11.158.220]] ([[User talk:108.11.158.220|talk]]) 02:15, 21 February 2012 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->\\n\\nhttp://www.europeancourier.org/99.htm\\n\\n02:19, 21 February 2012 (UTC)  <span style=\\\"font-size: smaller;\\\" class=\\\"autosigned\\\">\\u2014 Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/108.11.158.220|108.11.158.220]] ([[User talk:108.11.158.220|talk]]) </span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->\\n\\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/jul/19/not-genocide-deniers-uncover-truth\\n\\nI am aware that people like to accuse people of genocide denial for questioning Srebrenica, even though it's not genocide denial and questioning of it does not make one a genocide denier, or for that matter a bad person. How about real genocide denial? Like Holocaust Deniers and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran. Many of those that deny Srebrenica are people that want truth about the whole incident and genocide denial accusation shuts down all debate on the incident, even though much has to be discussed on the incident, such as bad eyewitness testimony, and smearing people as deniers, which I think is completely wrong because bad research was done in the incident, and ICTY made numerous mistakes.\\n\\nThe 8,000 number is also highly contested among academics and historians. How's that for genocide denial, eh? Did you want to smear people that have honest questions about the incident, using honest research as deniers of the incident and genocide denial?\\n\\nSrebrenica Historical Project has documented researchers being accused of genocide denial. This accusation is stupid and childish.\\nSrebrenica is still contested by academics and is considered to be theatrical by many people that nae-calling on the whole incident and protecting the incident by name calling, indicates that there is something wrong here. No more name calling. Please cite Ahmadinejad's Holocaust statements as genocide denial, instead of the contested Srebrenica Genocide thing, which is being disputed on Wikipedia and academia throughout the world. Shutting down debate by using the word genocide denial is wrong. It's not genocide denial.\\n\\nBesides, it's contested whether or not Srebrenica IS or constitutes a genocide, by many experts.\\n\\n\\n02:32, 21 February 2012 (UTC)  <span style=\\\"font-size: smaller;\\\" class=\\\"autosigned\\\">\\u2014 Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/108.11.158.220|108.11.158.220]] ([[User talk:108.11.158.220|talk]]) </span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->\\n\\nhttp://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/reliefweb_pdf/node-105000.pdf  <span style=\\\"font-size: smaller;\\\" class=\\\"autosigned\\\">\\u2014 Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/108.11.158.220|108.11.158.220]] ([[User talk:108.11.158.220|talk]]) 02:37, 21 February 2012 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->\\nhttp://www.juliagorin.com/wordpress/?p=2371\\n\\nCalling it genocide denial, while the event is highly contested, I think is a bit premature, don't you?  <span style=\\\"font-size: smaller;\\\" class=\\\"autosigned\\\">\\u2014 Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/108.11.158.220|108.11.158.220]] ([[User talk:108.11.158.220|talk]]) 02:41, 21 February 2012 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->\\n\\n== Cenk Uygur ==\\n\\n* [[Cenk Uygur]], host and co-founder of [[The Young Turks]] expressed denial of the Armenian Genocide in letters published by The Daily Pennsylvanian in 1991 and Salon in 1999.

Since we mention the US' definition, we need to classify it with a term that's just as vague and broad as their definition and includes all kinds of people--not just those of certain ethnicities like 'ethnonym' means. Ties to a Spanish-speaking country (with ties meaning anything like lineage, birth, culture, and language to name a few) doesn't describe an ethnonym because it doesn't group ethnicities. Classifying 'Hispanic' as a cultural heritage or lingual heritage better suits the US definition.\\n\\n==My understanding of the \\\"Hispanic race\\\" confusion==\\nI've a deep insight of (atleast applicable to the US) some people's typical view of Hispanics racial-wise; the subconscious decision of whether or not one is Hispanic based on race, which is always: a)Native Americans like the Aztecs or Incas which could be your average Mexican, or even some Native American-looking people like ethnic South East Asians like indigenous Filipinos. b)Mixed Native American and \\\"black\\\" and/or \\\"white\\\" (or mestizo, a racial slur). c)\\\"white\\\", only of Southern European descent i.e. Spanish ethnicity, Greek ethnicity, Portuguese ethnicity, Italian ethnicity etc (Makes sense. There are loads of ethnic Spanish and Portuguese Hispanics in the Americas). d)Obviously mixed people i.e. Obama. \\nOne will fall into one of these catagories should someone else deem them as Hispanic-looking. As for the stereotype of being mixed race, that's because racial mixing somehow prevails in many Hispanic countries. My observation leads me to believe it is ignorance of what exactly ethnicity and race are among hispanics that weakens racial barriers to allow for seamless racial admixture without the racism. I mean, just look at the number of hispanics choosing \\\"some other race\\\", which I feel helps prove my point. Many feel 'Hispanic' is their race and so the race question is seen as redundant as they've already identified as Hispanic. The Hispanic label (a special one at that; there are none like it, which I feel adds to its confusion in the US. Now imagine in all of Latin America [there are very poor educational systems in many Latin countries]). It supports racial mixing by giving Hispanics a name which they feel united by, often confusing it for an ethnicity or race even. Plenty assume their nationality is their ethnicity, and feel comfortable mating with whoever is born in their home country with the belief that they're of the same ethnicity, under the same race of Hispanic. <small><span class=\\\"autosigned\\\">\\u2014&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:67.80.46.224|67.80.46.224]] ([[User talk:67.80.46.224|talk]] \\u2022 [[Special:Contributions/67.80.46.224|contribs]]) 06:20, 13 April 2015\\u200e</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned -->\\n\\n: I want to hear what the wikI community thinks of this.

There is often confusion and uncertainty about what race is in many Latin-American cultures (despite the fact that in some societies, at least the elites seem more conscious of this and classes often correspond somewhat to ethnic/racial divisions stemming back to the colonial era). Anyway, yes, it's evident that many labeled as \\\"Hispanic\\\" in the U.S. didn't know what to put on the census forms. That's why you have a disproportionately high amount of them identifying as \\\"white\\\", when clearly that's not the case. The majority are of mixed or mestizo origin; in fact,as you said, the primary identifier of a \\\"Hispanic\\\" person in the U.S. is the mixed native/Spanish appearance. Not saying that's right, but in reality that's often how it's seen (at the same time I don't even know if most Americans appreciate or recognize the Amerindian contribution to Latin Americans, ironically). There's a lot of ignorance on these things. Another place on the list on this page that seems off is Puerto Rico, where there should be a much higher amount of \\\"mulatto\\\" or mixed white/Spanish with African, but that category doesn't even seem to exist.

Even when the term Hispania was used to refer to the whole region, the Portuguese were still called \\\"lusitanos\\\" and the region \\\"Lusitania\\\". The usage of \\\"Hispania\\\" during the Rome Empire and the Middle Ages would be like \\\"America\\\" for the continent nowadays- in this sense a Brazilian is a \\\"american\\\" because lives in South American, but the term will be rarely used like this, because \\\"American\\\" normally relates to USA citizens. Likewise, a Portuguese would be likely called a \\\"lusitano\\\" then, not a Hispanic. And that was then, not now - it has been CENTURIES since the term \\\"Hispania\\\" was used for the Iberian Peninsula - Hispania/Spain relates to a country now, not the the region. The region is IBERIA now.  People from Portugal and other former portuguese colonies like Brazil call themselves LUSOPHONES (\\\"Lusofonos\\\" in Portuguese) and NEVER Hispanics.

There is no one, distinct, Hispanic culture, so there is no point picking nits like this. Distinctions like \\\"Hispanic\\\" and \\\"Latino\\\" attempt to oversimplify a broad and diverse group of peoples, and do so in regards to their deviation from \\\"normal\\\" white American and Northern European culture.

In this context, the Castilian-speaking peoples of Spain have become a minority, like once were the non-Castilian peoples of the Iberian Peninsula in front of the Castilians, and thus, many cultural and linguistic issues relating the Spaniards are often confused and mixed with those relating to Mexicans and other Hispanic American peoples. Today, although some people not only from the Hispanophone but also from other parts of the World are conscious of these issues, they are still very few in front of the, although young, deep-rooted tradition that the terms Hispanic and Latino have generated among the Latin American community. The majority of the so-called Latinos do not know the real meaning of the term Hispanic, and thus perpetuate the bad usage of the term and spread it over the Americas, reaching the United States of America, and leading to the appearance of the ethnic label. Nowadays, the same reasons that have provoked all this ignorance and confusion around the words Hispanic and Latino are still prevailing, and the so-called Latinos, among other people from all over the World, especially in the United States, keep the bad usage of the terms and, paradoxically, many of them support the ethnic label that surrounds these words, considering themselves as people of a different race, as Hispanics or Latinos, and thus establishing a common link among them, but at the same time, excluding and alienating more and more the other Hispanics from Spain (both the Castilian and the non-Castilian-speaking) and also the Latin peoples from the rest of the World, who are not included in this new definition they have given to the term Hispanic.\\\" I believe this sheds some light in this discussion...

English nationalism grew strong anti Spanish since the XVI century, when Spain was the foremost world power. This type of nationalism went hand in hand with Protestantism and the Beginnings of Nordicism. In this context some Northern European nations were envious and jealous of Spanish success (Holland, Belgium, Luxemburg, parts of France and Germany, and also most of Italy) became Spanish colonies (by the way, not only Hispanic America). In this situation, a strong anti Spanish propaganda began to emerge, that due to the fact that it coincided with the birth of the racial doctrine known as Nordicism (born out of an inferiorty complex of Northern Europeans towards successful Southern Europeans at the time and in history) began to take racial overtones. In this line of thinking the Spanish began to be attacked as being a different race that wanted to subjugate Northern Europe, a race that was supposed to be even Non/White, or at least less white. It was the only consolation they had left for their mediocrity at the time, and this myth was made specially strong by the English and then by the Americans, who passed it on onto the Hispanic Americans as a whole, this myth being reinforced by the mixed origins of Mexicans , their neighbors.\\n\\n\\nIn fact, this myth has become very strong due to Anglo Saxon Propaganda for centuries. Let's take an example:\\n\\nOften the stereotype about the Spanish is about a short and swarthy person, stereotypes that have often been elevated to the categories of racial features, representing a race apart.\\n\\nLike the field of genetics is presenting important surprises, \\n\\n\\nhttp://www.scs.uiuc.edu/~mcdonald/WorldHaplogroupsMaps.pdf\\n\\n\\nother studies are doing the same in relation to body height and skin pigmentation.\\n\\nAbout body height, recent studies show that the average young Spaniard is even taller than the average Briton, and young Spaniards are still growing.\\n\\nSee: http://www.economist.com/specialreports/displayStory.cfm?story_id=12501087\\n\\nFrom there I cut and pasted this:\\n\\n\\\"The improvement in Spaniards\\u2019 lives is instantly visible. Many elderly people are short, stunted by the hunger they suffered as children in the hard years of fascist autarky after Franco won the civil war of 1936-39. Young Spaniards are strikingly taller than their grandparents, exemplified by Pau Gasol, who measures seven feet (2.13 metres) and was voted the most valuable player when Spain won the latest world basketball championship.\\\"\\n\\n\\nSee also:\\n\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_height\\n\\nAbout skin pigmentation, in a 21st century study that disregards the effects of tanning, Spaniards have some of the lighest skins in the world.\\n\\nSee page 18.\\n\\nhttp://www.bgsu.edu/departments/chem/faculty/leontis/chem447/PDF_files/Jablonski_skin_color_2000.pdf\\n\\n\\nIf are too lazy to read it here is a summary. The link is to a page that is controversial but the summary is good. In fact you can check it in the original paper if you are diligent. I include it here for those too lazy. You can also see some shocked reactions that reflect the preconceived vision of reality and its reactions before facts.\\n\\nhttp://racialreality.blogspot.com/2006/01/skin-reflectance-of-selected-world.html\\n\\nIn short, it seems that some features that were related to race have more to do with the environment and living conditions than with anything else.\\n\\nThe myth of the Spanish and racial overtones were also part of the black legend:\\n\\n[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-12664573_ITM Here] is an illuminating account,\\n:''cultural critics and historians such as Roberto Fernandez Retamar, Benjamin Keen, Patricia Shaw, David J. Weber, and, most recently and convincingly, Eric Griffin, have dedicated hundreds of pages to understanding the development and persistence of the Black Legend in Europe. In his excellent study, Eric Griffin outlines the evolution of English anti-Spanish sentiment from the early modern period to the present and discusses how an uncritical acceptance of many ethnic stereotypes that began in the sixteenth century can be traced to the present day. He begins by mapping out the Black Legend as it appears in Christopher Marlowe's The Jew of Malta, in which one can see an essentialized representation of the Spaniard as \\\"other.\\\" In Marlowe's work, as in the contemporary European films I shall discuss in this essay, the villain utters Spanish phrases at key moments in the articulation of the plot. Griffin insists that by emphasizing the villain Barabas's Spanish-ness, Marlowe reinforces through literature the stereotype of the avaricious Spaniard that was already widespread as a result of the translation and diffusion of Bartolome de las Casas's published accounts. Griffin then points to Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice, which dramatizes \\\"much the same kind of ethno-nationalist problem\\\", concluding that \\\"in the English public mind of the 1590s, anti-Semitism and Hispanophobia seem to have been two sides of the same coin\\\".''\\n\\n\\nIn short, the Spanish as a race apart is part of a type of propaganda that is very old in Anglo Saxon countries. Then, if we take into account that Anglo Saxon countries in general and the US in particular are so obsessed with racial issues and with the so strong desire of presenting themselves as the whitest in the world (funny this all started with an inferiority complex), there you have it all: Spaniards are not that white and people of Hispanic America are not white either, even if they are of 100 per cent European ancestry. This all is very funny and interesting if the roots of the issues are well known. \\n\\n\\nIf to finish this contribution we add that 21st century genetic science is proving that the English themselves and the Britons come mainly from the Spanish, the comedy is served.

Your friends from Spain who are Non-American citizens would call themselves Spanish first and foremost rather than Hispanic cause Hispanic is the old term that includes Portugal.

People in the US are conditioned to classify people by race despite the fact that racism was discredited in the rest of the world in the 1940s (Ever heard of Hitler?).  This is a good example of how uneducated and ignorant people are in the US.  The Spanish terms Hispanohablante (Spanish speaker) and Anglohablante (English speaker) give some insight into a different cultural perspective where the distinction is language and by extension culture.  Please try to move beyond this fixation with whether someone is a \\\"White European\\\" or an exotic Indian.

Its a historical fact that the Spanish had almost continual warfare with the English and later British empire for domination of the New World for about 200 years. Dispite what was written in English language history book, the Spanish were largely sucessful miltarily gainst Britain in defending there Empire more so than any other European colonial competitor, including France. The Armada battle of 1588 was a defeat for the Spanish, but it is a historical fact that the Spanish won that war which ended in 1604. Given what I've just explained. that 200 years of warfare left a very bad taste for the Spanish in the English and later Anglo American psyche. That is why English speaking historians and writters saw the need to invoke racial propaganda against the Spanish much like the term \\\"Hun\\\" was used in WW1 against the Germans. If you read newspaper caricatures from the past, they often portray the Spanish with hawk noses and very dark skin that is not truthfully characteristic of real Spanish people.

There are other approaches that are not governamental: [http://books.google.com/books?id=Y-iZai2uv_sC&pg=PA292&lpg=PA292&dq=sociology+hispanic+meaning&source=bl&ots=Ti-vj37QUy&sig=S0qp9sL2AwyXgC3tyNjEH6m26UI&hl=en&ei=XNPcS_iyDoui0gS7_rTDBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CA0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=sociology%20hispanic%20meaning&f=false pg292].\\n\\\"Most people still commonly known in the United States as Hispanic do not define themselves as such. The label hispanic is confusing because it forces people to identify themselves with conquistadors and settlers from Spain, who imposed their culture, language, and religion on indigenous people, and on the African people they enslaved\\\"(just like happened in the USA), \\\"For Latin Americans, who, like North Americans, fought hard to win their independence from European rule, identity is derived from their native lands and from the heterogeneous cultures that thrive  within their borders\\\"[http://books.google.com/books?id=n_iOp9MfdRkC&pg=PA241&dq=sociology+hispanic+meaning&as_brr=3&cd=10#v=onepage&q=hispanic&f=false pg 237] The sociological point of view is quite interesting. The linguistic is another one:\\\"The noun Hispanic was produced and promoted\\\"by people who found it bureocratically or politically usefull to denote large, diverse aggregates of ethnic peoples in a few simple cathegories\\\" There has been opposition to this collecting into a mass so many people of diverse origins.

This is one very poor article. I hope you can add  useful information instead of leaving it so confusing. Also try to add the father of the confusion: \\\"The ethnic label \\\"Hispanic\\\" was coined by a Hispanic New Mexican senator, Montoya, who wanted a label that could be used to quantify the Spanish-speaking population for the US Census.\\\" [http://www.sens-public.org/spip.php?article653] The reason to invent the label was to count the people that spoke castilian.\\n:The answer to your question \\\"What ''Hispanic'' is?\\\" is precisely what we are trying to cope with in these articles. I'm positive about ''Hispanic'' cannot be '''a single''' thing, given the disproportionate weight of informal usages. That is the reason why considering various views and confronting them would probably be the best option for WP editors. In this sense, it is certainly possible that we know better what ''Hispanicization'' is than what ''Hispanic'' is, if I explain myself fine enough.\\n\\n:As for further editions, the article sections you are focused on (namely, \\\"Definitions in the US\\\" and \\\"Hispanicization\\\") are summaries of other discussions about the subject: the primary articles for this topic are [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]] and -in particular- [[Hispanic/Latino naming dispute]].

I recommend the editor to look forward for the topic he wrote about through the following articles [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]] and [[Hispanic/Latino naming dispute]].\\n\\n'''''Hispanic Creation:''' This word was created by the Reagan and Nixon Administration's. This is and was sociological labeling. This word was dormant until the Cuban community called themselves \\\"Hispano's\\\". However, Reagan and Nixon changed this word from \\\"Hispano\\\" to Hispanic. The new movement is \\\"Latino\\\" which is inclusive to all peoples of North America, South America, Central America and neighboring islands of European and Indigenous heritage. Another reason to consider Latino over Hispanic is Quetzalcoatl, a serpent like bird found in archaeological finds of North, Central, and South America, and neighboring islands. It is said there were four primary tribes that historically crossed the Beren Strait into North America, South America, Central America and neighboring islands. The four primary tribes were Iroquois, Navajo, Aztecs, and Incas. It is said as they migrated, families separated and more tribes were formed. The movement is \\\"Latino\\\" for peace, and to educate populations to prevent a \\\"Latino\\\" apartheid by 2050. This is continually removed from the website and can be verified that presidents declared this name and fact that \\\"Quetzalcoatl\\\" exists. It is sad, is there a bias?'' \\n\\nSalut, --[[User:IANVS|IANVS]] ([[User talk:IANVS|talk]]) 03:02, 22 April 2010 (UTC)\\n\\n== Florida ==\\n\\n\\\"...Florida have been home to Hispanic peoples since the 16th century, long before the U.S. gained independence from Great Britain. These and other Spanish-speaking territories were part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain, and later Mexico, before these regions joined or were taken by the United States in 1848. Some cities in the U.S. were founded by Spanish settlers in the 16th century, prior to the creation of the Thirteen Colonies. For example, San Miguel de Galdape, Pensacola and St. Augustine, Florida were founded in 1526, 1559 and 1565 respectively, Santa Fe, New Mexico was founded in 1604, and Albuquerque was established in 1660. Therefore, in some parts of the U.S., the Hispanic cultural legacy predates British influence. For this reason, many generations have largely maintained their cultural traditions and Spanish language.\\\"\\n\\nPerhaps the best idea would be not to incorporate Florida in this made-up history.  Florida was not part of the 13 colonies, British rule came between two periods of rule from Havana, and when it entered the US (1810 and 1819) that had nothing to do with Mexico. Florida was not ruled ever from Mexico but from Havana, West Florida and East Florida separately. While in northern New Mexico there are still a few people who claim heritage from the original Spanish conquistadores, and so the definition of \\\"Hispanic\\\" for them does not really include \\\"from Mexico or Latin America\\\", in Florida there have not been any residents descended from the early Spanish settlements since the two great evacuations of Spanish residents back to Havana, in 1769 and in 1821.  Florida was mainly a military outpost not mining or plantation economy as elsewhere. In 1821 there were very few people living in Florida, certainly few \\\"Hispanics,\\\" and most by far of mixed origin, as there was no sense of modern racism. For example, in St. Augustine, although the city has been occupied since its founding by Spanish in 1565, the longest-residing inhabitants are Minorcan.  But Minorcans (from Minorca, Balearic Islands) are not Hispanic in the sense that they descended from the Spanish rulers.  They spoke an Eastern Catalan dialect not Spanish and when they came to Florida in 1768 they were British indentured servants.  I don't think any \\\"Hispanic\\\" culture in Florida actually dates back to continuous occupation since the Spanish rule, but has instead been re-imported from Cuba by different people, for example cigar workers in Key West and Tampa.  So it is wrong in my opinion to include Florida in this blanket account of \\\"Hispanic\\\" deriving from some history centered on Mexico.  Just because there was some Spanish occupation doesn't make the land or culture \\\"Hispanic\\\" any more than Indiana French, for \\\"legacy\\\" you have to have continuous history of occupation and culture, and you can't show that with Florida.

I have to wonder from whence your information  comes, because frankly much of it is simply not true, at least as far as West Florida is concerned.  It is true that such Hispanic heritage that carries forward from the 18th century has nothing to do with a \\\"blanket account of \\\"Hispanic\\\" deriving from some history centered on Mexico,\\\" but as it has been pointed out, the Floridian colonies were never administered from Mexico, but from Cuba and with great influence from New Orleans and the Louisiana's \\\"Florida parishes\\\" from c. 1784 to 1801, during Spain's administration of that territory, and then until 1821. A substantial number of Spanish troops settled in and around Pensacola (Escambia County) following Galvez' victories at Mobile and Pensacola and there was additional migration from New Orleans after the Louisiana Purchase. Many of these people remained after 1821 because the US government ratified land grants made by the Spanish throne. So, yes, this was more than a military outpost; and there was a plantation, ranching, timber and even rudimentary manufacturing economy: several brick-making operations sold and shipped bricks back to New Orleans where they paved the streets of that city.

Would be nice if you signed you posting or were more precise instead of sending multi-meaning double messages.\\nYes Jacques Chirac led France in the period of economic cooling or slowdown. He had so many internal problems that he couldnt solve. But we all know about cyclic system of laisez fair market economy. May be the next president Royal will come and do nothing or may be she will try to change it... or implement welfare reforms (Who will need them? we all know that Chirac indeed was very lefty). But, again. as a matter of chance, her presidential period can coincide with economic boom and she can be remembered later as a good reformist leader...Overall, so far as I am on the planet Earth I do not remember any French president who was a bad leader for France. Valerie had lots of internal economic problems as well, but overall he was a very good president. Mitterand was just brilliant. He did so much for France.. And Jacques Chirac was very competent in external affairs, balanced policy, Eurointegration. But most of all I will remember him for his love for French football....I will always remember how he jumped when Petite scored the 3 goal in Stade de France, how he defended Zidane when Zizou really needed that.... I will always remember his modest and humble wife Bernadette, their elegant mannters and intelligent actions. Again, Monsieur Chirac, Mercie beaucoup. we will always love and support you and France. --armenianNY 01:22, 17 March 2007 (UTC)\\n\\n==Parody==\\nNow don't get me wrong, I hate Chirac as much as any other red-blooded American, but I don't think we should have a section devoted mostly to negative portrayals in an article about a standing head of state.

The scheme, thought to have been put in place in the late 1980s, is said to have benefited all major political parties. \\nOnce again, Mr Roussin and Mr Mery were implicated, leading the investigation, which opened in 1997, in Mr Chirac's direction. \\n\\nIn July it was revealed that large sums of cash, allegedly totalling almost 2.4m francs ($320,000), had been used to pay for trips for Mr Chirac and his family and close colleagues between 1992 and 1995. He says the money came from his personal allowances, but investigators believe it may have been one way of spending the illegal commissions. \\n\\nFake RPR jobs: This investigation, opened in 1996 by Judge Patrick Desmure, relates to fictitious jobs given to members of Jacques Chirac's RPR party by private firms - who would be granted public contracts in return - and the Paris town hall between 1988 and 1995. It is alleged Mr Chirac knew of the arrangement. \\n\\nSempap fraud: This investigation, which began in 1997 and is headed by Judges Armand Riberolles and Marc Brisset-Foucault, examines allegations of fraud and favouritism towards the Sempap company, responsible for the Paris town hall's printing requirements between 1986 and 1996 while Mr Chirac was mayor.\\n\\n:Do not forget his closeness to Juv\\u00e9nal Habyarimana. --[[User:Ionius Mundus|Ionius Mundus]] 13:36, 20 June 2006 (UTC)\\n\\n==Going to the US==\\nFunny thing, the info about JC's problems when firstly going to US because of his left wings ties I could only find it on the en.wp but not on the fr.wp.

[[User:81.250.60.215|81.250.60.215]] 16:19, 18 July 2007 (UTC)\\n81, I disagree with your removal of  \\\"The Osirak Controversy\\\" section. This was not simply a \\\"warm word of welcome given in the past to a current dictator\\\", this appeared to be an ongoing relationship which resulted in significant financial deals, sales of nuclear reactors and significant military sales  (\\\"It is reckoned that during the 1980s, 40% of France's arms exports went to Iraq\\\") and with both Chirac and Saddam referring to each other as \\\"Dear friends\\\". Of course, it is true, that at the time  Saddam had warm relations with many world leaders. For example, as noted by the [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3324053.stm BBC News], Donald Rumsfeld was another Western political figure with question marks over his head concerning his dealings with Saddam. Certainly, [[Donald Rumsfeld]]'s article includes an image of him meeting on what appears to be friendly terms with Saddam in 1983 and a section detailing the meeting and the fact that Rumsfeld \\\"brought many gifts from the Reagan administration. These gifts included pistols, medieval spiked hammers even a pair of golden cowboy spurs\\\". To include this kind of information is not unique to the Chirac article.\\n\\nIf you feel that there is an undue weight issue, then please, feel free to write more about Chirac's period as Prime Minister between 1974\\u201376. However, the relationship which developed between Chirac and Hussein during that period has been discussed extensively in the worldwide media. I understand you are French, or that you live in France, and it is possible that you are not fully aware of the extensive international news media's coverage of Chirac's relationship with Saddam when he threatened to use France's veto in the UN Security Council and in the lead up to and in the immediate aftermath of the war. I feel Y was correct to revert your removal of this section, but I would encourage you to consider writing more about Chirac's period as PM. Also, please note that the English Wikipedia does not take its lead from the French Wikipedia. That the French Wikipedians have chosen not to write about this is of no consequence to en-WP, nor is the coverage in other biographies you may have read. Though, I can tell you that if you google both names together, you will find thousands of articles which reference their relationships. As well, Chirac was questioned directly by the Western media on numerous occasions and there are various transcripts of these interviews available on the internet. '''[[User talk:Sarah|Sarah]]''' 20:24, 18 July 2007 (UTC)\\n: There are two points to discuss : removal of a section title, which after all was a bad idea, at least at the moment (there is no other section yet, so let's see). The removal of the quotation is what matters most.\\n: As a day-to-day reader of UK and US press, I'm quite aware of Chirac's depiction here and there. I also disagree with the extensive treatment of the Saddam - Rumsfeld relation during the Reagan era. In both cases, the stress put on things higly insignificant per se worries me. Just to show the issue is not americano/franco-philia/phobia, Rumsfeld's relations with Saddam are also dealt with very briefly in fr:. I believe we have different views about \\\"notability\\\" and \\\"trivia\\\". I feel that accumulation of noise does not make music. Moreover, in both cases, the '''choice''' of stressing unimportant things, without the slightest intent of giving the general background (how many world leaders have been called \\\"friends\\\" by Chirac ? it would be shorter to list those that haven't, I believe) seems POV to me. [[User:81.250.60.215|81.250.60.215]] 21:41, 18 July 2007 (UTC)\\n\\nI do not like Chirac, he was a corrupt president, but I am not sure the American people hate him for good reasons. I think this section is misleading. One could believe that these France-Iraq deals are the reason of Chirac's opposition to the second gulf war. It should be put into context: France sold about $12 bn worth logistics/weapons from 1974 to 1988, while only from 1984 to 1987 the Reagan adm. provided Saddam with $40 bn aid to buy logistics/weapons and sent him $billions more to keep him away from the Russians. The arms were bought indifferently from the US, UK, France, Russia. (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_hussein, and details in the National Security Archive http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB82/) while the French provided a nuclear plant, the Americans provided chemical weapons... what is worse...? tie?  \\nThere is no mention of all this in the Reagan biography (why ?) Therefore one could think that France was the main, or worse, the only weapons supplier (it was the main supplier... after the US and Russia !). I think we should add a paralel of this section in the Reagan Bio, if not, recall here that Saddam had even more military help from the US and particularly the Reagan adm. \\n\\nOne should also recall that in 1990 Chirac strongly backed the US and the first Gulf War and the dismantle of saddam's regime. He regretted that Europe had not a stronger stance against Saddam Hussein after the invasion of Kuwait (see for instance \\\"Jacques Chirac : une certaine absence de l\\u2019Europe\\\", Georges Suffert, Interview de Jacques Chirac, Le Figaro 12&13 janvier 1990, page 6). Now you can quote the seemingly friendly words of Chirac to Saddam in 1975. But remember that in French diplomacy, you have to use \\\"cher ami\\\" (dear friend) for an ally, whoever he is, since in French \\\"ami\\\" (ally/friend) is the natural opposite of \\\"ennemi\\\" (enemy). And of course Saddam was considered an ally by the US, France, UK...against Iran. \\n\\nSarah: of course if you google it, you will find thousands of articles about a \\\"saddam-chirac friendship\\\", as well as thousands articles saying that the french have forgotten what the US did in WW1&2. Now come back to reality: these articles were all written after 2003 by Americans/Australians (international coverage, eh ? The same journalists would try to prove there were WMDs in Iraq). Of course, if you go to France and ask around you (as I did), everybody still remembers that the US freed them twice. Similarly, looking back at the unclassified docs of National Security Archive and at the news coverage in the 1980s, it seems that the Reagan-Saddam ties were stronger in 1986 than the Saddam-Chirac ties ever were in 1975 (when Saddam was not yet the dictator and the mass murderer he became a few years later). \\n\\nIn conclusion, Chirac had corruption scandals, which has to be strongly emphasized. But when it comes to Iraq, you cannot pick a few facts here and there and forget others, in order to suggest that he supported Saddam's dictatorship more than everybody else in the western world. What Chirac said about Saddam during first Gulf war say it all.

I feel that this is not directly relevant to the narrative of Chirac's biography; his friendship is already well described in the article. Chirac's comments are part of the flowery diplomatic niceties permitted of a French president, and I am certain many examples of his expression of admiration of other leaders exist, and is thus no reason for inclusion of any such quotes in this article. [[User:Ohconfucius|Ohconfucius]] ([[User talk:Ohconfucius|talk]]) 03:46, 5 September 2008 (UTC)\\n\\nI agree. This was most likely just diplomatic niceties.

It is unreferenced, but deals with a controversial topic that could damage Chirac's image to certain readers. In that vein, it either has to be solidly verified or it should be gone. Plus, it is just tagged in there and doesn't fit in any way with the flow of the article, like an afterthought. If solid, reliable sources can be found to verify that Chirac is against the wearing of islamic headwear, then it can be readded in the article in a better way that better flows. (I do understand that Islamiphobia is rather widespread in France right now). Until then I felt that removing this section was necessary per [[WP:BLP]].

I've never heard anything about this other pentathlon, the one Thorpe is reported to have won. [[User:TacoDeposit|Taco Deposit]] 14:13, Aug 13, 2004 (UTC)\\n::Well, he definitely won it, the IOC website says he did. Unfortunately, they don't say what events were actually in it. There is [[http://www.nativeamericans.com/JimThorpe.htm one website]] which has a biography of Thorpe on it that lists the five events, but I'd rather get some firmer evidence for it than rely on something someone has written on a webpage with no cites. The BBC has on more than one occasion said the pentathlon Thorpe won contained the events in the Modern Pentathlon, but they're wrong - the IOC website itself gives one Gosta Lilliehook as the winner of the Modern Pentathlon, and the Pentathlon Thorpe won is listed under the Athletics category. [[User:Average Earthman|Average Earthman]] 15:13, 13 Aug 2004 (UTC)\\n:::Gosta Lillehook won the first Olympic 'Modern' pentathlon, and this Jim Thorpe article seems correct.  In 1912, 1920 and 1924 there were two pentathlons at the Olympic games. One was the 'modern' and the other the 'traditional' (athletics) pentathlon.  In addition the athletics pentathlon was replaced with the decathlon.  The modern pentathlon was not to replace the athletics version it was a new independent event.

[[User:Daycd|David D.]] 20:55, 2 May 2005 (UTC)\\nWhile I cannot offer any sources, I remember with pretty good confidence, from reading a young-adult book about Thorpe which was definitely written before 1980, that all his events at the 1912 Olympics were track and field.  (There was an anecdote about how his entire preparation for the long jump consisted of making some chalk marks on the pavement.)  I don't have the book any longer, but it made a great impression on me and I reread it many times.

Unless something can be repeated consistently and recorded 'accurately' then there is no fact involved.  Considering something as great is in itself by definition arbitrary and an opinion.  Although you can assemble all the facts you want to support your case, in these instances, you are making arbitrary opinions.  You cannot compare Presidents across timelines and varying circumstances or sports figures in different eras especially from totally different sports and arrive at a calculated and accurate result based on facts.  They cannot be neutral although certainly people can try to be unbiased as humanly possible.  While I agree there must be general guidelines to follow let's not deceive ourselves into believing following the letter of the law automatically begats neutral and unbiased findings.  And there is not necessarily any lack of neutrality in forming opinions.  There are thousands of statements in Wikipedia based on references from very biased authors who have managed to get their opinions in media.  I've read the rules and I see no problem with making statements based on personal communication or unpublished data either which is well accepted in the scientific community.  Even anecdotal evidence is admissible when attributed as such.  BTW, I have a doctorate with six years of formal post-doctoral training, years of experience and have published.  We certainly need to police Wikipedia properly but we do not need to have censorship under the guise of playing by the rules.  Who decides what is neutral?  [[User:Jobberone|Jobberone]] ([[User talk:Jobberone|talk]]) 03:29, 6 February 2012 (UTC)\\n:[[WP:TLDR|tl;dr]].

Where we disagree is I believe you are hiding behind a set of rules thinking you are protecting neutrality when what you are doing is providing censorship in its name.  You are failing to observe what is generally considered a consensus which is a great part of the concept of neutrality.

Thorpe is in fact a descendant of Chief Joseph.  The reason white ancestry was bullcrapped in there, was owing to his athletic prowess; in Thorpe's time there was much racism against the native americans, and owing to the poverty of most natives in this country, although in Thorpe's reservation there have been much protests regarding his ancestry, said reservation has been unable to retalliate legally.  Regarding Thorpe's ancestry please revise it; certainly the man doesn't even look Irish.  For god's sake he couldn't even grow a beard!  Yes, that is important, because full blooded native americans can't grow beards, and the ability to grow a beard is something you inherit from your father.  White father, native mother = boy who will grow a beard, however, native father + white mother = boy who will be beardless, or grow very little face hair.  In a local reservation here where I reside, a lot of male descendants of native americans never have to shave; ever.  As a race, the native americans are beardless (the males).  The spanish had a term for the \\\"condition;\\\" in spanish, a man who can't grow a beard is referred to as a \\\"lampi\\u00f1o,\\\" it literally means \\\"bald face.\\\"  \\n\\nThorpe, was never known to have worn a beard, so his paternal Irish ancestry is highly suspect.  Part of the reason Islam, and even Judaism, have been accused of being false religions, is native american beardlessness; both Islam and Judaism, talk about the sacredness of the beard yeah well, what happens when a man can't even grow one?  See, full blooded native americans, pose a problem; if Islam truly came from \\\"God\\\" you would think \\\"God\\\" would know that a race of men can't even grow beards wouldn't you?  If there are any anti-muslims out there, the very existence of full blooded native americans, presents a powerful counter argument; how the hell can a man be like Mohamed, the prophet of Islam, if he can't grow a beard?  The author of this article, please take the time to visit Thorpe's actual tribe, and not rely on white scholars.  His paternal Irish ancestry is highly suspect, and the sources can not be trusted.

There has been a shift in the usage of LGBTQ, especially in colleges and at the [[Avant-garde|tip of the politico-cultural vanguard]], and from where I sit, it's gaining ground.  However, Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and by its nature follows general usage, it [[WP:NOTLEAD|does not take the lead]] in causing or driving change.  As of 2008, usage of LGBTQ in books [https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=GLBT%2CLGBT%2CLGBTQ%2C+LGBTQI&year_start=1985&year_end=2008&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2CGLBT%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CLGBT%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CLGBTQ%3B%2Cc0 was on the rise], but still lagged well behind ''LGBT'', which seemed to be gaining ground even faster than LGBTQ in published sources. With attempts to include ''questioning'', ''intersex'', ''agender'', ''allies'', ''pangender'', and perhaps others, many other initialisms are attested, and some at the bleeding edge of change might see ''LGBTQ'' as already hopelessly inadequate.  It's perfectly okay for Wikipedia to report on any of these terms ''inside'' an article, given adequate [[WP:RS|reliable sources]]. Given sufficient [[WP:GNG|notability]], one might even be able to make a case for a separate ''LGBTQ'' article, but imho that would be highly likely to turn into a [[WP:CFORK|content fork]] as it covers the same ground, and thus is not a good idea. [[WP:COMMONNAME]] says {{xt|..some topics have multiple names, ... this can lead to disagreement about which name should be used for a given article's title. Wikipedia generally prefers the name that is most commonly used (as determined by its prevalence in a significant majority of [[WP:SOURCES|independent, reliable English-language sources]]).}} By that standard, LGBT seems to be the leader for the time being. If and when it can be demonstrated that ''LGBTQ'' has clearly replaced it by the same standard, the article should be renamed.

It depends on WHAT you want to grow back.  Different tree species grow back optimaly under different conditions.   Douglas fir, a common species in Western Oregon, Washington and southern British Columbia doesn't regenerate properly under the conditions you advocate.   Natively it is a 'fire cycle' tree that regenerates well on scorched earth which is easily emulated by mechanically removing the forest organic cover and exposing mineral soil for planting  (or seed sprouting)   IF a layer of duff and other organics are left to cover the soil it will rarely get started.    On the other hand tree speciies such as Western Red Cedar and hemlock start quite well in duff and on nurse logs.   the hemlock is somewhat more prolfic in growing and less tasty to the deer and elk so for the most part, nature is not taking its course---you are making an active management decison----do you want Douglas fir or Hemlock to grow here???? when you decide either to clear to mineral soil  or not.\\n\\nLikewise Douglas fir won't start in the shade as it is extremely shade intolerant, so if you are going to start a Douglas fir--- you will a) get rid of the shade and b) get rid of the duff and other stuff on the forest floor down to mineral soil.\\n\\nThis is why Hemlock and cedar are known as late successional species.   they will grow up through the douglas fir and ultimately kill the douglas fir out.   However the cycle is closed because in the process so much dead woody  material is created that the fire load gets up to a level that makes the forest highly flammable, and in due course  (typically a 100 years in dry climates and a couple hundred years in wet climates) all the suff burns up.   This disturbance clears the ground to mineral soil, and the cycle can restart.\\n\\nthe forest is dynamic.  It cannot be frozen in time.   A mature forest is one waiting to burn.  Logging is a management alternative for restarting the cycle without having a giant cataclysmic fire event.[[User:Rvannatta|Rvannatta]] 06:36, 21 August 2007 (UTC)\\n\\n==List of logging equipment?==\\nThere was a list of [[farm equipment]] and I was disappointed that there was not such a list for logging.

Even when just talking about the surface of the earth, don't forget that most of it is covered by water.\\n\\n== Disputed ==\\n\\nIntroductory paragraph has numerous problems including a non-neutral POV, and several dubious claims, such as \\\"logging must be restricted or the (sic) planets forests will not be restored\\\". It can be reasonably argued that logging is but one part of the rather complicated processes of land conversion and development that include road-building, logging, land-clearing, immigration & settlement, draining wetlands, agricultural conversion, and other development activities. Also, there are numerous examples of sustainable forestry that preserve forest health and productivity while including prescribed logging (harvesting) activities. [[User:Pradtke|Pradtke]] ([[User talk:Pradtke|talk]]) 12:22, 8 October 2008 (UTC)\\n\\nParagraphs about horse logging under \\\"Mitigation\\\" present unverified claims about horse logging. Terms \\\"biological woodsmen,\\\" and \\\"restorative forestry\\\" are buzzwords and should be deleted. Verification should be provided for claims of environmental benefits of logging with horses (e.g., reduced soil disturbance, erosion, or soil compaction). The bulleted items under this section describe methods that are disputable regarding their sustainability for maintaining productive growth rates of trees left after others are cut. Also, questionable for purposes of regenerating desirable tree species. The selection of trees for harvest described here is not recognized as a valid silvicultural term -- see the explanation under \\\"Invalid term\\\" on the page [[Selection_cutting]].

Almost no references, and those that there are are taken for just a couple of studies. Swathes of values judgements about what people must do. Whole article needs to be re-written from top to bottom.

[[User:Guettarda|Guettarda]] ([[User talk:Guettarda|talk]]) 15:49, 10 October 2008 (UTC)\\n\\n::::A point I think that can be made clear is that deforestation and (production) forestry are not the same thing.

It does not seem that this scope includes political opinions as to whether this process and technology is 'good'  or 'bad'.  Most of the references do not seem germaine to the topic nor do the extended remarks about 'illegal logging'  --- there is a separate page on that with a link to it so no need to repeat that page here.\\nSimilarly the section on 'safety' adds nothing to the page.  Were it to evaluate the risks associated with the alternative logging methods, or be designed to encourage readers not to try this at home, then I would have no problem with it, instead it appears to be a pointless diatribe[[User:Rvannatta|Rvannatta]] ([[User talk:Rvannatta|talk]]) 22:27, 6 December 2008 (UTC)\\n\\n== \\\"Healthy\\\" logging? ==\\n\\nDoes anyone know if there are any \\\"healthy\\\" methods of logging that are actually good for forests? Are those the methods used? There needs to be some mention of this. (please post insight here, even if just hearsay, so we can have a basis for doing more research)--[[User:Dario D.|Dario D.]] ([[User talk:Dario D.|talk]]) 21:58, 10 June 2009 (UTC)\\n::Politics and timber harvest often get confused.   Logging is nothing more than cutting down a tree and doing something with it.  that 'something' can range from burning it on site to get rid of it to clear the ground for other uses, to transporting the resulting logs to market for usually wood or paper products.\\nThere is not even wide agreement over what is 'good or 'bad' for a forest.   The healthy forest concept is based on the precept that violent forest fires are 'bad', and therefore management actions designed to reduce  the intensity and frequency of forest fires is 'good'.   If you like to see forests burn, then you will disagree with the application of the words 'good' and 'bad' in this context.\\nThe underlying factual issue is that forests, if unmanaged in temporate areas such as North America accumulate underbrush\\nand other flammable materials  (fire load)  fairly rapidly.   How rapidly depends on rainfall and climate, but I think there is some consensus that in dryer areas of the west it's around 100 years, and probably 200 years on the high rain fall coastal areas of the Pacific Northwest.   The 'Healthy forest' view is that once the forest accumulates enough to  'fire load' to be flammable it is simply a fire waiting to happen, and unless you like to watch forest fires this is 'bad', with the preferred approach being to actively manage the forest and remove sufficient of the flammable materials so as to reduce the fire hazards.\\nIn the days before fire fighting, particularly in the dryer areas there were very frequent fires which tended to keep things burned down to the point that sufficient materials to cause a major conflagration often did not accumulate.  However, in the last century we have tended to put forest fires out when possible, which over time has set the stage for ever more massive fires, unless we offset this by reducing the fire load in some other fashion, i.e. health logging.[[User:Rvannatta|Rvannatta]] ([[User talk:Rvannatta|talk]]) 06:01, 15 June 2009 (UTC)\\nThe trees grow back so it is all healthy.  <span style=\\\"font-size: smaller;\\\" class=\\\"autosigned\\\">\\u2014Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/66.36.251.180|66.36.251.180]] ([[User talk:66.36.251.180|talk]]) 04:45, 29 December 2010 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->\\n\\n== false statement ==\\nI removed a sentence \\\"Ecologically minded timber companies plant two trees for every one tree they harvest.\\\" This is false for several reasons.

It has more to do with the optimum spacing for growth and survival, intended use of the trees (sawtimber, pulpwood, or bioenergy) and management plan details such as whether thinning will be prescribed at mid-rotation.  Second, some species of trees regenerate naturally and don't require any planting after cutting. Third, there's no simple way to determine what \\\"ecologically minded\\\" means, especially as it relates to how many trees someone plants.

I have noticed how Ahmadinejad's better photos all end up being deleted [''surely'' just a coincidence], leaving only a bad selection available. I am not the only editor who has stated that the picture (hand-holding) is inappropriate. [[User_talk:Izzedine|<sup>Izzedine</sup>]] 02:29, 4 December 2009 (UTC)\\n:Your words and actions come across as arrogant. I hope you are trying to be civil and give the benefit of the doubt as to the intentions of me and other editors, as I am trying to be and do. It's not a horrible photo that you chose. I personally liked best the one from a couple of months back, with the white jacket, but apparently it wasn't permitted. As for the \\\"handholding\\\" photo, I don't see what was inappropriate about it. Ahmadinejad is smiling in it, it's a sunny day, there are people around, there is clearly a friend, colleague, or supporter, holding his hand, which in Iran is not as taboo as it is in the northwestern region of the globe. Relatives, friends, and others do it all the time. It can be a sign of non-sexual affection, a sign of solidarity, and sometimes its simply efficient, as it is when two people are trying to cross streets in Tehran amidst a frenzy of speeding cars. I know of this first-hand. Nobody doctored the photo; it was taken of the article's subject at an actual moment, and apparently it was a moment in which he was posing for a photo. Yours on the other hand was taken mid-speech with a non-background, and his demeanor is fierce and dogmatic, which is actually only one aspect of his persona, it's not even his complete foreign policy persona, it's his \\\"I am a man alone against the United States and the UK\\\" face, not an image of the domestic affairs Ahmadinejad which got him elected and re-elected. Your photo seems more biased to me, being exemplary of what we come to expect of Ahmadinejad. Angry yelling pointing finger man, alone in some strange place. Let's not have this article be as one-dimensional as that. It already suffers with enough Northwestern prejudice. So please try to tone down your \\\"do not\\\" warnings, and your use of the word \\\"inappropriate\\\". It doesn't build a friendly editing atmosphere.

I am striving to leave my personal politics out, please respect Wikipedia guidelines and not make this a place where we let out our hopes and frustrations over world politics. We're supposed to work towards amassing a wealth of soberly neutral coherent information. But when I ask you what makes your photo more appropriate, you show personal bias by saying \\\"what's not appropriate for one nation's leader is not appropriate for another nation's leader.\\\" THAT is bias. Ahmadinejad is not Obama and not Blair. He has many different views and beliefs, a different set of customs, a different language, a beard, no tie, I could go on and on. To understand what I'm talking about, visit [[Gandhi|Gandhi's page]], where you will see a photo of a political/spiritual leader who appears to be naked and his right nipple showing. The choice of this photo was not because of some ulterior motive of disrespect. This is Gandhi's customary look. It's a decent photo for him. (Actually, personally, I think it is a beautiful photo.) So, I hope you are beginning to see that I'm not insisting on the previous photo for any \\\"motive\\\" other than to choose the best photo available to convey the complete entity that is \\\"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\\\" and not one that only shows one negative and heavily propagandized side.

Also, can't a book cover be described without its image being shown? Maybe it would help myself and other editors understand if you'd give an example of an \\\"iconic\\\" image.

We have plenty of free images of MA, AND, to make matters worse, the image in question has American and Canadian rabbis ([[Yisroel Dovid Weiss]] and fellow [[Neturei_Karta#Split-up_of_Neturei_Karta_into_two_branches|Neturei Karta offshoot]] members), so not only is the image unnecessary, it is irrelevant.

He  just says things that some people badly want to hear, and that seems to  be the only thing that keeps him afloat in the media. Regarding Mr  Ahmadinejad not having served in the War, it is not true, but from a  technical point of view Mr Khaz'ali's story may contain some element of  truth. The fact is that Mr Ahmadinejad was not fighting as a regular  army soldier or officer, but was working party as a military logistic  engineer and partly as a military intelligence officer from behind  enemy's line. If my memory is not failing, during the War years he spent  some time in [[Kirkuk]],  Iraq, amongst members of the [[Patriotic  Union of Kurdistan]] or [[Kurdistan  Democratic Party of Iraq]]  --- both groups  were fighting alongside Iran against Saddam Hossein. The fact that after  the War he, i.e. Mr Ahmadinejad, became the Deputy to Governor-General of [[Maku, Iran|Maku]]  and [[Khoy]]  ([[West Azarbaijan Province]] has a sizeable Kurdish  population), and later Advisor to Governor-General of [[Iranian  Kurdistan|Kurdistan]],  have direct relationship to his War-time experience in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]].  Thus, indeed Mr Mohsen Rezai may not have been technically wrong in  saying that Mr Ahmadinejad has not been \\\"at the front\\\" (assuming that  indeed the alleged statement is due to Mr Rezai), but to say that Mr  Ahmadinejad has lied about his War efforts, is just a false and  defamatory statement. Let us assume for a moment that Mr Ahmadinejad has  lied about his War efforts. Is it at all conceivable that a young man  from Tehran would get so early on so high up in the highest  administrative offices of Maku, Khoy and Kurdistan, from all places? As I  said earlier, Mehdi Khaz'ali is just a fantasist who seems to believe  in his own fantasies (there are some videos on ''YouTube''  in which he says things that no one in his position could possibly  know).

Please care to search on e.g. ''YouTube'' (see, let us say, [http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=september+11+conspiracy&search_type=&aq=3&oq=September+11 this page]) and notice that there are ''Americans'' who are propounding conspiracy theories about the September 11 atrocity. Further, I should point out that during his one but last visit to the headquarters of the UN in New York, Mr Ahmadinejad asked to visit the location of Twin Towers (i.e. the Ground Zero), to pay respect to the dead, but the New York authorities declined his request, citing \\\"security reasons\\\" as their reason for declining the request. Be it as it may, to my best knowledge no one has ever ''denied'' September 11 happening, however there are some who ''question'' the official explanation as to who stood behind the event. It could be that Mr Ahmadinejad has also questioned the official explanation, but there is a world of difference between the denial of the official explanation and the denial of the event itself. Lastly, I should point out that there were also Iranians amongst the dead on September 11. In this connection, you may wish to search for the Iranian feature film ''The [[Ziggurat]] Goddess'' (about which [http://www.mehrnews.com/en/NewsDetail.aspx?NewsID=9495 here]), 2004, with [[Shahab Hosseini]] in the main role. This film revolves around the life of a young Iranian man who has lost his wife and the only child in the September 11 atrocity, and in fact the film begins with the scenes of the attacks and contains flashbacks of the last telephone conversation that this man has had with his wife and daughter minutes before the first attack in which they were killed.

The talk-message above is completely irrelevant, and should be ignored, as this user perhaps does not know that Wikipedia does not support commenting on Talk pages for a WP Page, as it is clearly conclusionary. Further more, 9/11 was not, by a long shot, the worst terrorist act in history. Maybe this will help us to stay neutral on this page. There has clearly been negotiation of possible Israeli involvement, but no proof. If he has clearly stated believing in Israel and the United States (Referring to the Bush Government perhaps?) Were behind 9/11, but this is supposedly nothing referring to the relationship between the 2 countries. Of course, his relationship to the 2 might be negative, he could have said it for any reason, because he has seen proof, because he accuses the 2 countries from hand, or for any other reason. I think this would require a new section, maybe 'Controversies of 9/11' or such. And there is no proof he supports any terrorist unit, or that he is by any means a 'bad guy' or a 'perpatrator' so the Wikipedia page WILL NOT claim it otherwise. There has been criticism towards him and the nuclear projects he supports, but criticism only owns a small section in this wiki page. Also, 9/11 is not very close to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's presidency and politics, so it should not cover too much space.

The Wikipedia is suggesting that:\\n\\n\\\"In 1976, Ahmadinejad took Iran's national university entrance contests. He was ranked 132nd out of 400,000 participants that year.\\\" \\n\\nThis information is absolutely manipulated and groundless for the following reasons:\\n\\n1) The applicants for nationwide university entrance exam could never reach 400,000 back in 1976. This could be investigated and verified by searching the \\\"ministry of science, research and technology\\\".\\n\\n2) The entrance exam in Iran has 3 fields: Engineering, medical and social sciences. Each applicant is ranked in his/her group. For instance, if you are an applicant the engineering schools, then you are ranked among applicants for engineering program and not the total number of applicants. No need to mention that even the total number of applicants participated in entrance exam back in 1976 never reached to even 1/6 of 400,000!\\n\\n3) In 1990 that I took the entrance exam, the total number of applicants were 750,000 among which 150,000 were for engineering programs. The statistics shows that almost always 1/5 apply to engineering programs, 2/5 social sciences and 2/5 medicals. This is based on capacities as well and the data could confirm the fact that Iranian universities have considerably higher capacities for medical and social sciences than engineering programs.\\n\\n4) Even if Ahmadinejad had taken the entrance exam in 1990 with almost double population than his time in 1976, he would have ranked among 150,000 and not 400,000!!!\\n\\n5) Iranian universities were closed from 1980 to 1983 due to the post-revolution anarchy. The entrance exam and the ranking system started in 1986-1987 and after the universities re-openned. This was the time that the nationwide entrance exam was started as a sample of equity and justice. Prior to the revolution in Iran in 1978, each university has its own entrance exam and no ranking system even existed. Thus claiming a ranking system in 1976, 2 years prior to the revolution, is untrue and groundless.\\n\\nThere are more proofs and evidence suggesting that the content is groundless and untrue manipulated by the current Iran's government to justify Ahmadinejad's preseidency given that Iranian people have respect and tendency towards educated candidates.\\n\\n\\n\\n<!-- End request -->\\n[[Special:Contributions/173.35.198.29|173.35.198.29]] ([[User talk:173.35.198.29|talk]]) 13:44, 16 August 2010 (UTC)\\n\\n[[File:Red information icon with gradient background.svg|20px|link=|alt=]] '''Not done:'''<!-- Template:ESp --> Welcome and thanks for wanting to improve the accuracy of this article.

My personal opinion is that at this time in history, there is no difference between the use of regime and entity when concerning zionism. there was no zionist entity prior to the zionist regime and if the regime in israel will cease to be zionist then israel will cease to be a zionist entity.  <small><span class=\\\"autosigned\\\">\\u2014Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Aonana|Aonana]] ([[User talk:Aonana|talk]] \\u2022 [[Special:Contributions/Aonana|contribs]]) 06:28, 8 September 2010 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->\\n:::::I agree that there can be no Zionist entity without a Zionist regime but a Zionist regime can still exist quite happily if Israel ceases to be a Zionist entity.

[[User:LibiBamizrach|LibiBamizrach]] ([[User talk:LibiBamizrach|talk]]) 15:17, 4 October 2010 (UTC)\\n:::::LibiBamizrach, what is shown in the diff I provided above is that your links were 'Zionist regime|the occupying regime' and 'Zionist regime|Occupying Zionist regime'. 'Zionist regime' is a redirect to 'Zionist entity', so your links were to 'Zionist entity' as Wayne said. As for my \\\"very weird silly argument\\\", there is nothing weird or silly about actions based on [[WP:MOSQUOTE]]. Since you can read English, I imagine that you can understand the meaning of \\\"''As much as possible''\\\" in the sentence, \\\"''As much as possible, avoid linking from within quotes, which may clutter the quotation, violate the principle of leaving quotations unchanged, and mislead or confuse the reader.''\\\" My understanding of that statement is that it means, if it is possible to avoid linking from within quotes, avoid linking from within quotes. This is sensible advice because linking someone's words to a Wiki article can impose a meaning on those words that is not contained in the statement they made and consequently it can mislead readers.\\n\\n:::::Any link from someone's words to an Wiki article contains an implicit interpretation and assumption that what they said is accurately described by the contents of the article being linked to. Sometimes this is fine, sometimes it isn't. Obviously, if someone says \\\"car\\\", it's probably not a problem. If someone says something more complicated like \\\"Occupying Zionist regime\\\" you could link it to [[Israel]] or [[Zionist entity]] or [[Israeli government]] or who knows, [[Revisionist Zionism]] etc etc. Or you could link each individual term individually e.g. \\\"Occupying\\\" to [[Occupied territory]] or [[Israeli-occupied territories]], \\\"Zionist\\\" to [[Zionism]] or [[Revisionist Zionism]] and so on. There are a lot of choices but the point is that they are choices and the choice is an editorial decision made by you based on what you think about the words and the content of the article you are linking to. Different people will look at the same quote and they will link it in different ways. That should already tell you that linking from within quotes is inherently problematic. I would like you to reconsider your views.\\n\\n:::::What is sad about all this is that when I looked at the refs being used, none of them supported the precise wording used in quotations in this article. The very least we can do is match accurate quotes to the actual sources that support those quotes. In fact, we are obliged to do that by [[WP:BLP]]. For example, look at the 3 sources being used to support \\\"the occupying regime\\\" and try to find that phrase. I couldn't find it. I found \\\"Zionist Regime\\\" and other descriptions instead. I imagine that what has happened is that in the POV push and pull that plagues articles like this, the information has been shredded by people, much like yourself, who place advocacy before policy and damage content. <small style=\\\"border: 1px solid;padding:1px 4px 1px 3px;white-space:nowrap\\\">'''[[User:Sean.hoyland|<font color=\\\"#000\\\">Sean.hoyland</font>]]''' - '''[[User talk:Sean.hoyland|talk]]'''</small> 17:12, 4 October 2010 (UTC)\\n:::::::Then please go ahead and practice what you preach.

The effect is to prioritize words not spoken by Ahmadinejad ('wiping Israel off the map'), as given by tabloids and newspapers, over the words he actually spoke, as reported and analysed by two chaired specialists in Iranian language and culture, [[Juan Cole]] and [[Katajun Amirpur]]. The Western scholarship on the Farsi text's meaning cannot be called a 'fringe theory', and describing the English version in a state propaganda newspaper as more reliable than  a scholarly translation confirmed by area experts is weird. \\n\\nOur article clearly shows that it is not disputed the Admadinejad in his Farsi speech did not use this expression. In my view, one is obliged to provide the man's actual words before entering into the controversy over their translation in the Iranian News Service. For those who cannot access [[Katajun Amirpur]]'s article, I'll transcribe the words below. She is an Iranian-German authority (and critic) of the present government of Iran. She has a professorial chair in this area.  The wire-services are citing the Iranian English, the scholars are citing the Farsi original.\\n\\n<blockquote>The new quality in A\\u1e25mad\\u012bnezh\\u0101d\\u2019s attacks is their increasing shrillness and the regular increase in their volume in response to the Western world\\u2019s reaction to his verbal aggression. In the following, I will analyse the statements in question with special regard to the time at which they were made. In October 2005, A\\u1e25mad\\u012bnezh\\u0101d gave a speech at the \\u2018A World without Zionism\\u2019 conference in Tehran which included the following sentence: '''\\u201cThis regime that occupies Jerusalem will disappear from the pages of history.\\u201d''' The Iranian news agency IRNA\\u2014or in Juan Cole\\u2019s opinion a Western wire service52\\u2014'''mistranslated''' this as: '''\\u201cIsrael must be wiped off the map\\u201d,''' which caused considerable consternation. In fact, '''the Persian counterparts for \\u2018Israel\\u2019, \\u2018map\\u2019, or \\u2018to wipe off\\u2019 do not appear in the speech.''' Nonetheless, all major news agencies took up '''the false translation,''' and IRNA did not release a correction.[[User:Nishidani|Nishidani]] ([[User talk:Nishidani|talk]]) 19:01, 5 October 2016 (UTC)</blockquote>\\n:The first thing that's clear is that you misread the edit summary, which is no problem and happens sometimes. What was described as a fringe theory was the claim that the translation was propagated by wire services. This had been attributed in the article to Amirpur's paper, which was behind a paywall. As Nishidani has shown however, Amirpur also correctly described the translation as originating from the Iranian government, with Juan Cole being the one ascribing it to wire services. However, the newspapers themselves also attributed it to the Iranian Government translation. (http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/27/world/middleeast/irans-new-president-says-israel-must-be-wiped-off-the-map.html?_r=0). The Iranian Government translation, which came first, is what is written first in the article. It is then followed by the competing claims about the translation. Neither translation is given preference in wikipedia's neutral voice, and nothing was removed. There's clearly a dispute over the translation, the Iranian Government, NY Times, and others translate it as wiped off the map, using sense-for-sense translation, while others like Amirpur and Juan Cole use literal translation. As an aside, literal translation is generally considered bad practice, particularly because it's poor at translating idioms, and not frequently done in professional work. (http://www.copypanthers.com/resources/literal-translation/, https://books.google.com/books?id=myLDA0_brhcC&pg=PA858&lpg=PA858&dq) Wikipedia needs to have a neutral voice. Describing the Iranian Government translation, which was backed by the New York Times and others as a \\\"mistranslation\\\" isn't appropriate. What my edit did was to simply place things in the correct order in time. Stating \\\"was translated by Iranian state-run media\\\" and then going immediately into both sides of the dispute.

Wikipedia obliges us to get the facts straight, and neutral, esp. in regard to living persons. A translation is not the first text. The first text is the Farsi speech as it was diffused through Iranian media, to which both Juan Cole and Katajun Amirpur had access, like any other Iranian or expert. (b) The words are not those of Ahmadinejad, but, as the scholarship shows, a citation from Ayatollah Khomeini.(c) The text, like many news services used, spun this as what Ahmadinejad said. \\n:::That specialists in Iranian studies clarified the original, translated it literally, then wrote articles outlining how it got turned into the version that circulates in English, thanks to the curious spin the mistranslation gave to it in Iran's official paper, is all that counts.

How can anyone 'recant' a quotation remark mistranslated into another language, and attributed to him or her? Every source that contradicts the IRNA translation comes from qualified specialists who nowhere hide their disgust for the political arrangements in Iran, contempt for the dominant political party, so this has nothing to do with 'whitewashing'. By the same 'read-between-the-lines' logic, one could easily claim that all those papers and wiki editors that insist on prioritizing the challenged quotation in English do so to screw or blackwash an incident and a person on behalf of Israel, or the United States.

Can't we just link to a website for stuff like that? --[[User:Ed Poor|Ed Poor]], November 2002\\n\\n: Although the person commenting on the fact that the quote is the best part of the page sort of shows it's value, I'll answer your question more directly: first, the first quote isn't from her comedy routine, it's from an NPR interview. And secondly, quotes from comedians are valuable to an encylopedic entry if they give an example of the type of material they address; anything factual that can help clarify for the reader the content of the entry is valuable. -- Anon (68.16.134.146), July 15, 2003\\n\\n:: The source of the Asian origin quote needs to be specified. (What's NPR? Magazine? Issue #? Year? Or tv episode airing date?) --[[User:Menchi|Menchi]] 18:04 15 Jul 2003 (UTC)\\n\\n:::NPR is National Public Radio, as in the most famous American radio station in existance. (Arguably, perhaps, but c'mon, seriously.) I don't know what the airdate of the quote was.\\n\\n: I think the 2 quotes are basically the essence of her humour: what she experiences the most. We could incorporate those into the main body and chop the complete quote into pieces, but that sounds like an academic research paper, and the original quotes loss their true flavour. In any case, most ppl are too lazy to click on an additional link -- external most of all -- even it's right in front of their faces. However, I think anything more than 3 quotes might not fit into this page and needs to go into the articles on her shows or whatnot. --[[User:Menchi|Menchi]] 18:04 15 Jul 2003 (UTC)\\n\\nWe have the Wikiquote project for that very purpose....I am always confused as to why people insist that they need to fill the Wikipedia article with quotes.

Naming dogs after cars and actors is not notable - as already determined by a prior consensus.  If anything should be discussed, it is whether naming a dog after a terrorist is notable. [[User:Asiatic Flu|Asiatic Flu]] 18:54, 4 April 2007 (UTC)\\n\\nShe also named the dog after the Valkyrie Gudrun of Norse mythology, which is just as notable. Her naming of her dog after the Actor Ralph Fiennes is just as notable for revealing something about herself.

[[User:Asiatic Flu|Asiatic Flu]] 00:58, 7 April 2007 (UTC)\\n\\nSorry Larry, Asiatic Flu is making a lot more sense than you are.  Naming a dog after an actor or a car is just not notable, but naming a new model of car after a dog, or an actor named after a dog might be.  For example, \\\"Hey, I'm driving an 07 Beagle,\\\" or \\\"The Oscar goes to Spot Goldstein.\\\"  Now those might be notable.  What IS notable is naming your dog after a German terrorist - that's downright perverse. [[User:MonkeyHateClean|MonkeyHateClean]] 03:22, 6 April 2007 (UTC) Hey - I just remembered that Indiana Jones named himself after the family dog - that's a riot. (from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade)\\n\\nNaming a dog after an actor and a goddess are both notable bits of trivia. Asiatic Flu simply wishes to highlight the naming of one pet because of his/her POV about what it means. If it is notable, so are the others, and of interest for the same reasons that trivia about a well-known figure is of interest. Perhaps this should be moved to the personal life section in fact. Asiatic Flu has also inserted a blatantly false statement (which I take to be his/her POV and interpretation) into the main part of the article, which is not supported by any source and he/she should refrain from doing so again. --[[User:Larrybet|Larrybet]] 23:11, 6 April 2007 (UTC)\\n\\nNaming your puppy after a terrorist is sick - and therefore note worthy.  The other names - not so note worthy. [[User:63.164.145.85|63.164.145.85]] 16:10, 6 April 2007 (UTC)\\n\\nNo - it is your POV that it is both sick and noteworthy, and you are pushing your POV, including in a false statement you posted elsewhere on the page that Cho admires a terrorist. There is no source that supports that. In fact, in the source you list, she states that this is a 'bad name for a very good girl,' which signals to the reader no such admiration that you are attempting to ascribe to her. Another, and more common, POV is that many people name their pets 'bad' names for a variety of reasons. Al Capone? Killer? Little Devil? There is an entire website devoted to cats who look like Hitler. You cannot post your particular POV as fact. According to the source, the dog in question is also named after a Norse goddess, a fact which you keep deleting to suit your POV. --[[User:Larrybet|Larrybet]] 23:11, 6 April 2007 (UTC)\\n\\nI agree with the idea that one of the dog's names is no more/less significant than the others (no matter how odd I may find her name selections).  I don't see that any of the pet names are significant enough to include in an encyclopedia article about her. [[User:Aleta|Aleta]] 01:45, 7 April 2007 (UTC)\\n\\nI have done as Aleta advised.  I hope other editors can be satisfied with that direction and stop their antics. [[User:Asiatic Flu|Asiatic Flu]] 22:56, 7 April 2007 (UTC)\\n\\nAgreed. Also, I am glad to see someone edited your heavily POV and libelous claim that she has expressed admiration for terrorists (blatant lie). I have also moved the statement you are trying so hard to keep in here, to the trivia section, as both the exact quote and the extended context prove that it has nothing to do with her political advocacy. Actually, I do not find it worth mentioning even in trivia, as one could pull any number of trivial quotes from a blog and throw up on a wiki entry. I propose that it be removed unless you can show cause as to why it is is relevant. --[[User:Larrybet|Larrybet]] 20:22, 12 April 2007 (UTC)\\n\\n:Note, per [[Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/CantStandYa]], [[User:Asiatic Flu|Asiatic Flu]] and [[User:MonkeyHateClean|MonkeyHateClean]] are the same user, sockpuppets of banned [[user:CantStandYa]]. -[[User:Will Beback|Will Beback]] \\u00b7 [[User talk:Will Beback|\\u2020]] \\u00b7 04:09, 13 April 2007 (UTC)\\n\\n== Sex and the City appearance ==\\n\\nMy memory isn't the best, but didn't she appear in an episode of Sex and the City?

LOL  I don't know that this article needs to be split so much as it needs an editor who is willing to take the lead in eliminating the gross overkill level of trivia and minutiae, and developing a new consensus around a reasonable and balanced level of detail in describing Vick's legal and financial problems per [[WP:W]].  We need to know that he filed bankruptcy, the total amount of his debts, and the outcome of the case.  We don't need to to know the names of every creditor and the judge's disposition of those individual debts.  Likewise, you don't need the complete history of every pleading in his criminal cases.  The charges should be identified, the outcomes stated, and the sentences given.  The current level of detail is not appropriate.  If you can't reduce the level of detail in the main article by consensus, then by all means split off separate dog-fighting and bankruptcy articles.  If you want someone with a legal background to take a whack at these sections, let me know, but I will need a lot of talk page support and protection from the folks who are guarding this page as it presently exists.

Failing that, a complete rewrite of the section relating to Vick's criminal activities, prosecution, sentencing, and incarceration is badly needed.  As the section currently stands it is not possible to determine exactly how much time Vick did serve in prison (as opposed to how much time off for good behavior, or how much time was reduced due to completing the drug rehab program), or how much of Vick's time was served at Northern Neck and how much was served at Leavenworth.  It is also difficult and non-intuitive to determine, from the article as currently written, when he entered custody, when he began serving his sentence, when he qualified for the rehab program, when (if?) he was awarded any time off due to behavior or the rehab program, and when he was released.  (Yes, I see this last detail in the article but it's not placed anywhere sensible and nothing is done to call attention to it from the preceding, unrelated paragraph.)\\n\\nIn short, the chronology of his misadventure through the penal system is almost impossible to determine from this article without poring over this section and doing a good deal of detective-work.  The chronology should be clear from a glance.  I will wait for suggestions a bit before I start making changes; I'm sure this article's regular editors will want to weigh in.

However, the \\\"oppose\\\" side ultimately exhibited superiority of argument by referencing a solid policy-based argument in [[WP:LEDE]]; specifically that inclusion in the lede would be disproportionate to the breadth of exploration the subject is given in the body; this was not sufficiently rebutted.

To summarise, (1) the claim is not part of the most important points of the article.

In addition, I don't&nbsp;think one can dismiss the sources as fringe given that most were published by prestigious university presses, and as such quality as [[WP:RS]].

Not in the lead. Per [[WP:LEAD]] the lead is to summarize the important points of the article, but the article does not have any information on the neoliberal points.

Summoned by bot. 1) I don't see *any* mention of the 2007-08 financial crisis link in the article, which almost necessitates removal given the complex, non-consensus nature of the claim, per [[WP:LEAD]]. 2) As I noticed in the \\\"label\\\" RfC, it struck me as odd to call out this one impact, given that the article is discussing a 50-year trend, per [[WP:DUE]], [[WP:LEAD]]. 3) It's not a very good summary. The lead section is trying to chart the way this term has been used over time, this sentence doesn't fit the balanced way the article should go. Ideally the fourth paragraph should be improved and include this point while summarizing the current debate over the term and policies. [[User:Chrisvls|Chris vLS]] ([[User talk:Chrisvls|talk]]) 22:25, 10 February 2017 (UTC)\\n*'''Oppose''' - seems [[WP:UNDUE]] weight in being both not the predominant line about causes, and also not prominent part of the article so not [[WP:LEAD]] material but more something for down in the body.  I'm also somewhat dubious about the wording being the right characterization at \\\"some\\\" academics, \\\"root\\\" of finacialization, and at \\\"ultimate\\\" results as if it no longer is having effects.  I'd also note that financialization is not commonly understood so would be better to wikilink [[Financialization]].  Also, my impression is that the 08-09 issues tie more narrowly and it's only part of Neoliberalism (the 1990's Clinton repeal of Glass-Steagal) enabling part of financialization (derivatives) leading to housing bubble so while that stigma spreads it seems not accurate to say it as being the whole of each article.  [[User:Markbassett|Markbassett]] ([[User talk:Markbassett|talk]]) 23:38, 10 February 2017 (UTC)\\n*'''Sentence should be removed, pending article improvements.''' Summoned by bot. I agree with [[User:Chrisvls]] that the article is missing substantiating info for the proposed statement (which I see is in the article noe).  It's hard to argue that this particular sentence should be in the lede, when one of the largest article sections, [[Neoliberalism#Criticism|Criticism]], is virtually ignored in the lede.  There's an entire [[Neoliberalism#United_States]] section with no mention of the crisis.  Before the sentence should be in the lede in any form, that section should have some info about the purported link between the crisis and neoliberalism.  And, both sides need to be considered - are there sources that specifically say or simply imply that there's no link, or that the connection is overstated? If the sentence is going to go into the lede, and the first paragraph no less, for more balance, I could see something like \\\"There is disagreement among economists on the role of neoliberalism in the financial crisis of 2007-8; some academics see neoliberalism and related financialization as a cause of the crisis, while others claim ...{whatever can be found from the other school of thought}\\\" [[User:Timtempleton|Timtempleton]] ([[User talk:Timtempleton|talk]]) 00:51, 14 February 2017 (UTC)\\n* '''Unsupported''' No, obviously not.

These policies (not all of course) resulted in the 2008 financial crisis.  The lead does even go that far, it merely acknowledges that opinion.  You say that of course you cannot find any sources that say otherwise or provide any other explanation for the 2008 crisis, nor can you think of any other reason why it might have happened.  But the fact alternative facts or opinions do not exist in reliable sources does not mean those facts or opinions are wrong.  I suppose you feel that if the policies had been stronger and closer to neo-classical economics, bringing back the gold standard, abolishing welfare and social security, eliminating public schools and child labor laws, reducing government spending to 10% of GDP,  that the 2008 crash could have been avoided.  You might be right.  But we are writing about actual government policies, not what they should have been.  And the fact that these policies resulted in the largest financial crisis since the 1930s is significant, since economic policies are judged on economic results.  [[User:The Four Deuces|TFD]] ([[User talk:The Four Deuces|talk]]) 11:13, 8 February 2017 (UTC)\\n::: {{reply to| The Four Deuces }}  Whether I like the term or not is beyond the point. But we are getting somewhere. Note how much more nuanced is the statement: ''These policies (not all of course) resulted in the 2008 financial crisis.'' I think this is a marginal improvement over the current statement. But if not all policies are to blame, then which ones are? Addressing this is important in the spirit of precision and encyclopedic writing. Now, the lead paragraph is supposed to \\\"explain the subject so that the reader is prepared for the greater level of detail that follows\\\" (as [[WP:WBA]] states) and not to mention the opinion of some academic with no further reference in the article. As for the rest of your ''arguments'', I did not say I cannot find any sources that provide another explanation. Of course, there are a plethora of theories addressing the ''possible'' roots of the financial crisis. The takeaway is this: there are so many theories, that the sentence in question provides undue weight to a particular view. Here is a copy of what I already wrote, in case you missed it:\\n::: {{Quote|text=There is no academic consensus as to the entire causes of the financial crisis, [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?Abstract_id=1533211 Obstfeld and Rogoff] argue that it might have been caused global imbalances, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0416.2009.00147_2.x/full Acharya et al.] argue that it was because of systemic fragility due to financial integration of markets, [http://www.nber.org/papers/w14739.pdf Diamond and Rajan] attribute it to a complex set of conditions including (but not limited to) low interest rates, lack of information from credit rating agencies, complex security valuations systems, and more.

Neoliberalism was formulated by Walter Lippman's \\\"The Good Society\\\" in 1937, and the word itself coined, at least in its meaning in this context, in 1938 by Alexander R\\u00fcstow at the '\\u201cWalter Lippmann Colloquium,\\u201d organized by French liberal philosopher and logical positivist Louis Rougier.' The first line in the article is wrong: Neoliberalism REJECTS laissez-faire, and is ANTI-19th-century classical liberalism, perhaps better known today as the \\\"night-watchman state.\\\" As best I can tell, neoliberalism was \\\"democratic, tolerated a wide degree of regulation, plus welfare states, public education, and public provision of healthcare and infrastructure.\\\" Not free-market, and not classical liberal. https://fee.org/articles/what-is-neoliberalism-anyway/. I am not a student of neoliberalism in particular, but this article is written from the perspective of someone who associates it with a grab-bag of components from various ideologies, and needs a big rewrite to put down what neoliberalism actually is; where it came from; and its effects, good and bad, and why. I am sure this is a doable project, although finding Lippman's \\\"The Good Society\\\" as a necessary primary source, being the originator of the concept; although I can only find it for myself here (Google Books, library system) at the publisher's website, https://www.routledge.com/The-Good-Society/Lippmann/p/book/9780765808042, and it's out of stock.

For example here's a quote from his review of David Harvey's book 'Brief History of Neoliberalism' - \\\"They changed their minds over numerous issues, extending even what they should call their movement. They started out using the moniker \\u201cneoliberalism\\u201d(Friedman, 1951), but backed away from it over time, which helps explain why the designation is still so misunderstood in Anglophone contexts.Harvey(p.20)simply identi\\ufb01es neoliberalism with neoclassicaleconomics, but that is both a technical and philosophical error.

Indeed, recent work reveals that academic units such as the Chicago School of economics were founded as subsidiaries of the larger project, rather than vice versa, organized with extensive outside involvement\\\") and their ideology was not in anyway related to the Lippmann one. It even mentions various libertarian think-tanks in this quote (IEA, Atlas, etc.) and the Chicago School that was associated with libertarianism. Even the Mont Pelerin Society used the label libertarian when describing themselves. And the youtube video below, Mirowski mentions Cato.[[User:Actual neoliberal|Actual neoliberal]] ([[User talk:Actual neoliberal|talk]]) 19:06, 27 March 2018 (UTC)\\n\\n::::: Just because it simply mentions Hayek and Friedman doesnt mean the whole ideology can be classified one way or another. One has to go through the history or atleast read the prominent scholars of that history to realise what the movement was about and how it evolved over time. There were far more influential figures in the movement like Gary Becker or George Stigler but they arent really 'mentioned'.  Here's a link to Mirowski's talk where he specifically addresses this issue - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBB4POvcH18 at 7:40. As for the Chicago School of economics or libertarian think-tanks, associating them with libertarianism just demonstrates that one hasnt read through the cited scholars. Again, going through Mirowski and Plehwe or Angus Burgin, you will read about the matroyshka doll like structure of various think tanks or the mont pelerin society's uneasy relationship with libertarians with whom they never fully identified. If you read the IEA's history, you'll read about Hayek's role and how it has acted as a mother think tank that helps spawn and fund other think tanks that spout many different positions at the same time with the common goal of misinforming the wider public, gaining support across the political spectrum and buying time for the development of their policies/market solution. This has been covered again by Mirowski (for the sake of time here's his talk - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ewn29w-9I). If you go through other works, you'll read that historians often found through documents that Milton Friedman used to publicly say one thing but support another privately amongst mont pelerin society peers. This was a regular feature amongst the neoliberals, thought by historians to be inspired by Leo Strauss' Persecution and the Art of Writing. Ignoring all of this just shows that one hasnt actually read many of the scholars cited but simply picked and chosen parts that support the popular narrative, however wrong or confused it is.

Why did MPS members describe their organization with that term? (Milton Friedman's son is a member and he uses the term to describe the group: https://daviddfriedman.blogspot.com/2006/11/mont-pelerin-society-milton-friedman.html). At the meeting in 1978, the members were using the term too (https://www.libertarianism.org/publications/essays/mont-pelerin-1947-1978-road-libertarianism) Even the neoliberal politicians like Thatcher and Reagan used the term. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thatcherism and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwQxvFAIJY) \\\"There were far more influential figures in the movement like Gary Becker or George Stigler but they arent really 'mentioned'.\\\" They were both libertarians. \\\"As for the Chicago School of economics or libertarian think-tanks, associating them with libertarianism just demonstrates that one hasnt read through the cited scholars.\\\" So a libertarian think-tank should not be associated with libertarianism? The Chicago School was founded by libertarians (maybe you should edit this wiki page and let someone know just how wrong the entire page is? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_school_of_economics) You're not really making a point, but just restated the same people I stated were involved, then made unsubstantiated claims like Friedman had secret \\\"neoliberal\\\" views (that were somehow distinct from the views he stated in public), then danced around the fact that they (the people and organizations that Mirowski cites as key to neoliberalism) actually used the label \\\"libertarian\\\" to describe their views. \\\"\\\"this article is written from the perspective of someone who associates it with a grab-bag of components from various ideologies\\\"\\\" there were two/three distinct forms of neoliberalism, as Foucault stated (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17508480701494218?journalCode=rcse20), they didn't agree on a number of things, Rustow, Ropke were upset by people like Mises and Hayek being associated with neoliberalism.

Governments have shifted from policies of full employment, generous social benefits and deficit spending.  No one claims that the new policies are internally consistent or unchanging.  Neoliberals have both balanced budgets and rung up unprecedented debt.  They have pursued both high and low interest rate policies.  They have even raised taxes (see [[Read my lips: no new taxes]].)  If is not incumbent on scholars of neoliberalism to devise a coherent, internally consistent and unchanging ideology, but merely to describe actually existing neoliberalism.  And incidentally, the cult libertarianism that many Wikipedia editors favor is not neoliberalism, despite sharing common intellectual roots, such as Hayek and Mises.

It thematizes contested concepts in its core, not the actual lemma Neoliberalism.\\n:Additionally it is plain wrong or atleast very missleading since most of today's worldwide economies are classified as coordinated market economies so the implication of a similar success and spread of liberal market economy, like democracy which seems a real winning champion on our globe, is plain wrong. On top liberal markets are frequently cited as \\\"in deep conflict\\\" with democracy while the coordinated market system is exactly the adaptation of capitalism to democracy (see [[Third Way]]). This alone already proves the point, the deleted sentence tried to make, as very missleading. It does not share many atributes (which is a total weaselword phrase  on top) with democracy besices at best some academic tag called \\\"contested concept\\\" you could aswell stick on any of the 1001 \\\"inventions\\\" of the Milk industry.

The sentence you deleted (and the citation which followed the statement, which includes a quote to help explain exactly what the source is trying to say with this) was not making the case that the two operate in tandem (of course they are \\\"in deep conflict\\\", as neoliberalism fuels inequality and essentially oligarchy, but I digress...), but as both are global concepts put into practice they are similar in that, 1) they are geopolitically distinct in some respects (think of it this way, as both neoliberalism and democracy are adopted by different cultures and polity around the world, both will undergo changes to fit these societies, even though in theory they will retain core ideas), and 2) prone to modification over time. This is, I believe, partly why neoliberalism is such a hotly disputed concept, even though at its core neoliberalism is about the liberation of, and domination by, capital. I would argue that the so-called coordinated market economies you speak of have been modified by neoliberal ideas thanks to globalization, especially the ruthless austerity implemented throughout much of Europe in recent years (e.g., Sweden's explosion of inequality in the last decade is largely attributable to the adoption of neoliberal policies pertaining to austerity and privatization; Sweden is considered a \\\"CME\\\").

Granted, it wasn't seen as one during his times...It is interesting to observe how facial hair changes (or doesn't) throughout the centuries.\\n\\nThe early Roman Emperors used their outer image, notably their hairstyle and facial hair (or lack thereof), to depict their own political propaganda to the public. This idea began with Augustus, the first emperor and the patriarch of the Julio-Claudian dynasty of emperors. Augustus came to power after a period of instability caused by the war between Augustus and Mark Antony. Augustus was victorious in this long and messy war which marked the end of, what historians call, the Roman Republic. In order to show the Roman people that his reign is going to be a period of peace, stability, and prosperity, his hairstyle is very short and clean-cut, he is also clean shaven. This trend continued with the rest of the Julio-Claudians, Tiberius, Gaius (Caligula), and Claudius, except Nero. Nero showed a great animosity towards the Roman people. Various Roman sources even stated that Nero would shower spectators of gladiator combats and games with urine, instead of prizes like his predecessors. Nero\\u2019s animosity caused him to have an indifferent attitude to the way he was viewed by the people; and therefore, his hairstyle was often depicted as messy with dishevelled curls and the \\u201cneckbeard.\\u201d The Flavian dynasty, beginning with Vespasian, was responsible for cleaning up the mess that Nero made of the empire. Vespasian and his successor and son, Titus, followed the trend set out by Augustus, because they too had to clean up the mess left after years of instability and fear brought upon by Nero. Domitian, on the other hand, also a son of Vespasian and the successor of Titus, was considered by many of the Roman people to be a tyrant and he styled his hair very similar to Nero, although he did keep his face clean-shaven in most of the portraits depicted of him found throughout Rome. The period of the \\u201c5 good emperors\\u201d followed the reign after Domitian, after his tyranny brought about the end of the Flavian dynasty. Nerva, the first emperor in this category, was again responsible for cleaning up the mess of a tyrant and followed the trend set out by his predecessors by keeping his hair and his face clean. Trajan, considered by many to be the most successful emperor thanks to his many conquests and building projects, looked strikingly similar to Augustus in all of his imagery. Hadrian, however, was more concerned with becoming acquainted with the empire as a whole; and because of the significant lack of wars that happened during his reign he started a trend that lasted for the next 200 years. His hairstyle and beard were very full and curly, almost caveman-esque (although much more well-kept). In Nero and Domitian this image would have been seen as negative, but the image started by Hadrian, and followed by Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius, showed prosperity and growth.

Saying that something is a \\\"majority of the minority\\\" view lends undue bias to an opinion - at least, in my opinion. \\n\\n:For example, saying \\\"most/many Bible scholars believe\\\" references the personal opinions of a few hundred people.

There is no implication in Revelation as to what method should be used to find what the 666 means. There's no way one can assume that they should put the letters of Nero's Hebrew name through the process of Jewish gematria. Many things add up to 666; this is just an extremely obscure way of trying to solve the problem. It seems more like the solution (Nero) modifies the meaning of the original text, because 666 does not equal Nero; Neron equals 666. It also seems very suspicious that its possible to add the name up to either number (666 or 616), when of course, there was only one number used in the original book of Revelation. Its clear that they were searching for something that added up to both possible numbers in Revelation; its too obvious that the solution was constructed as an attempt to start another 666 conspiracy. I'd also note that it seems unlikely a people who would burn 'magic books' worth 'fifty thousand pieces of silver' would be expected to turn to a practice of mysticism (which may not have even existed at the time). (\\\"Oh, I know, let's use gematria on everyone dead Caesar's name! To see.. To see... Whatever that would prove.\\\")\\n\\nIn any case, it just doesn't belong in this article.

The Fifth Century writer Sulpicius Severus was the first known to have used Tacitus as a secular Pagan reference. The persecution may have involved resident Jews in the city of Rome, which began with a capitation tax levied on the Jewish community, among others, to help pay for the rebuilding of the city of Rome after the fire. Plus, \\\"Christians\\\" did not appear as a literary term before the Second Century AD, given that the first Christians were still very much indistinguishable from the existing Jewish population in the Roman Empire.

She's not only lived in England from birth to 5 1/2 years old but also from part of her teenage years to well into adulthood.

To just call her Australian implies that she was born in Australia. She is British and so to call her a British-Australian is suitable because she was born in the UK, was a permanent resident of UK for 15 or 16 years (her father was British; mother,German), Olivia even wanted to and did represent the UK in a song contest in the 1970s. She was an IMMMIGRANT of Australia and was a permanent resident for only 10 years. She didn't become an Australian citizen till 1994 and has been living in America for last 25+ years. Even John Farnham who's actually British didn't become an Australian Citizen till 1988 which allowed him to become eligible for the \\\"Australian Of The Year\\\" award which he won. This discussion leads me to wonder which famous 'Australians' are actually Australian-born and bred.

Who knows?  On the other hand, find a country that is not also in some way guilty of this.  Having read through the Newton-John article again (and I haven't bothered rereading the others) I think her Australian identity is mentioned appropriately.  It's not dwelt upon, or made the central focus of the article.  It's just mentioned - and for this particular individual it would be wrong not to mention it.  It should be mentioned of Mel Gibson too - he moved to Australia at age 10, I think, starting acted in, owns property in, has family in Australia, describes himself as Australia.  Should he be called an American born Australian. Yes, absolutely.  That's not desperately trying to claim someone just because they are famous, it's just a fact. He's Australian, and he was born in America.  Newton-John is Australian.  She was born in England.  Can't see a problem there.  I disagree with the comment that we ignore our own celebrities until they're appreciated elsewhere - that was once the case, certainly in for example Helen Reddy's time, or the 50's and 60s when the Bee Gees were starting out, or even Newton-John's career beginning, but given that we treat \\\"Home and Away\\\" teen aged cast members, and Australian idol contestants as, well, idols, I can't see that we're still guilty of ignoring those celebrities that are known exclusively in Australia.  [[User:Rossrs|Rossrs]] 12:09, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)\\n\\nAccording to the copy of the Encarta World English Dictionary I have in my possession, Olivia Newton-John is an Australian singer and actor. There is no mention of her place of birth at all. The entry for Mel Gibson says he is a US-born Australian actor. Is the Encarta dictionary incorrect on these matters? I'd tend to back the Encarta version over some of the nonsense I'm reading on this discussion page. You could be forgiven for thinking that Newton-John has only a trifling connection to Australia if some of the comments on this page are to be believed. However, if the associated Wikipedia article is correct then it would appear the Newton-John did in fact spend her formative years in Australia. Hence that she might identify as Australian is hardly surprising. I've not followed her career very closely, but from what I have seen it would appear that she is presented as Australian in the media, and interviews I've seen of her would appear to confirm the correctness of such a presentation. The  opening line of her Wikipedia article is pretty weak really, her Welsh and German ancestry hardly merits such prominence, particularly as it is mentioned later in the article anyway.

The actor says he now feels as much American as he does Australian and likes to think that he is part of both countries. He said, \\\"I don't think of myself as either American or Australian really, I'm a true hybrid. It's a good thing for me because both of them are really good countries.\\\" The Bee Gees are also British and they seemed fine with being British from what I've gathered. Olivia Newton-John has referred to herself as being English before and also more English than Australian back in the day - her comments can be found on older chat shows and old magazines despite what she says now. Of course no one would say she's also American although she's been living in the United States for most of her life rather than Britain or Australia. She's still technically a British person. Australia is as guilty sometimes as some other countries in looking pass the home-born and reared people in preference of a claiming tightly to famous people such as Newton-John as the representer of Australia. I'd probably decide to only pledge my undying allegiance to the country that worships me as their symbol too. I do think she's a fine singer and there are plenty of British entertainers like Newton-John that I like too. If we do not have enough confidence to show the world our people that do through and through share our nationality without any doubt from anyone, then I call it inferiority complex. Everyone is not naive about everyone's background. In the case of Oz, let the many real Aussies stand up and be noticed too by the world. They have talent to be proud of too. Anyway, each of us will most likely stick to our own opinion of a person's nationality no matter what each other's point of view.

Anyone know if this is true?\\n\\n::The BBC Wales programme ''Coming Home'' on 1st March 2008 mentioned her father's work at Bletchley Park.  He had joined the RAF and transferred to Bletchley Park because of his knowledge of German.  I don't understand the comment about him being in MI5 when he had joined the RAF and BP was part of the Foreign Office / MI6 rather than MI5.  When Rudolf Hess landed he was initially taken into custody my Home Guard Major Helm, he was then questioned by Chief Inspector Gray. MI5 had their own linguists so I cannot see they would need to borrow one from Bletchley Park (especially considering the relationship between MI5 and MI6)  --[[User:Jmb|jmb]] ([[User talk:Jmb|talk]]) 01:07, 3 March 2008 (UTC)\\n\\nThe paragraph about her family background contains this sentence: \\\"Newton-John's father was an MI.5 officer on the Enigma project at Bletchley Park who took Rudolf Hess into custody during World War II.[5]\\\". This sentence doesn't seem believable. I'm certainly no authority on Olivia Newton John, but I know a fair amount about World War 2, and something about code breaking (which was what Bletchley Park was focused on). For those who don't know, Rudolph Hess was a high-ranking Nazi official who flew to England shortly after the start of World War 2 with the intention of making peace with England. He was taken prisoner by the English and ultimately tried at Nuremberg and imprisoned. Enigma was a machine used by the Germans to encrypt messages. Bletchley Park was Britain's center for code breaking activities, and it was run by MI5, which is the UK's counterintelligence agency. So it's 100% believable that her father was with MI5 and worked on Engima at Bletchley Park. It's the Hess connection that doesn't make sense. To begin with the statement is factually wrong -- Hess parachuted out of a stolen fighter plane and was \\\"taken into custody\\\" by Scottish farmhand David Mclean (Bletchley Park is in England, nowhere near Scotland). The article on Rudolph Hess makes it clear that he was questioned by personnel from MI6 (the UK's intelligence agency), among them Ian Fleming (the creator of James Bond). He was moved around to various places and spent most of the War at a military hospital in Wales. But he never had anything to do with codes or code breaking, and it doesn't make sense that somebody from the Enigma project or Bletchley Park would even be talking to him. They were specialists focused on code breaking -- a very demanding and important job.\\n\\nSince the footnote is to a TV show, I don't have anyone of checking it to see if the author misinterpreted things or was just relying on gossip. If they were, Ms. Newton John would certainly not be the first person to have her family history embellished to make it more interesting.

Since she's an avid eco-activist really into environmental causes, Olivia Newton-John decided to launch a \\\"natural\\\" resort. I believe she had one in [[Victoria, Australia]] (or was it far south of [[New Zealand]]?), another one in South America ([[Chile]]?)...By coincidence, her only child/daughter's name ''Chloe'' (not spelled the same) sounds close to the country's name, then the TV special stated the namesake came from Newton-John's perfume brand in the 1980's. I'm glad to see she's not only a beautiful talented star, but smart enough to run a business and involved in saving the planet. The news press attacked her in the early 1990's when a tabloid front cover had a pic of Olivia Newton-John carried black trash bags on her lake (or beach) front property read \\\"Caught! Environmentalist Olivia Newton-John dumps trash in her beach!\\\" I think she sued them for libel and slander, and it happens that she's picking up litter from her own property, since it was a California beach as by state law, all beaches regardless of who lives by it, are open to the public.

It may or may not represent the community standard, but it is one edit by one editor.  (The same editor also says the intro is too short).   The length of the article is not in itself a problem - there are many articles including [[WP:FA|Featured Articles]] that are longer.   The real issue is content.   A couple of things to look at would be [[WP:RECENT]] and [[WP:TRIVIA]], and this may help decide what to keep, what to remove and how to present the information that is retained.     Relevance changes over time, and there is no reason that something that is relevant now, can't be included until some time in the future when it becomes less relevant, and then is removed.   A lot of articles evolve in this manner and it's a perfectly valid way of editing.    The ''Sordid Lives'' comment is already in an earlier paragraph, so it is redundant and was correctly removed.     I think some of the other information was in a too-detailed form and perhaps a shortened version would be better than no inclusion at all.   The bushfire fundraiser is worth mentioning, in my opinion, but only in relation to Newton-John.   There was a lot of extra detail that belongs in the bushfire article.   I'm not convinced that \\\"current endeavours\\\" is a good idea as a seperate section.  I think the information should sit at the end of the later career section, and it can be updated depending on how relevant the information stays over time.   I think the image probably should go.

This is a topic of fierce debate within that community.  Some hold that only civilian Panama Canal Company workers and their dependents qualify, while at the other end of the spectrum others state that everyone who ever lived in the Zone, including military personnel stationed there, however briefly, are Zonians.  The moderate consensus agreement seems now to be that if you spent enough time there to think of it with a sense of homesickness, you qualify.  (Yes, this is original research, but there's nothing else available unless one wishes to pore over something like the archives of the Zonelink Yahoogroup.)\\n\\n:Anyone who will have spent enough time in the Zone to qualify as a Zonian will, of necessity, have learned at least enough Spanish to get around.  I personally know of only two Zonians whom I would say are unilingual, but of course I have also known many others, passing through the Zone, for whom we would have to translate.  I can't speak to the Time article itself, but if it makes a claim inconsistent with what I've written here, my response is that it is incorrect in this regard.\\n\\n:At any rate, even assuming that that factoid is correct, it's not germane to the topic itself.  I could write a long and passionate passage about how hated Jimmy Carter is in the Zonian community, and while it would be factually accurate, it would be similarly inappropriate.\\n\\n:As far as the 1964 riots, I believe a short and dispassionate mention somewhere in the entry would be appropriate, along with a link to the WP entry.

Thats for snobbish Zonian-Americans to debate.  There were lots of Americans there, and most were temporary, and didn't care and/or didn't need to learn Espanol.  Becuase there was lots of Americans.  To the Panamaninans, they were all \\\"Americans\\\".  The riots played an important role in changing US policy, and the facts mentioned in the Time article are germane to understanding the cultural shape of the former Canals Zone.--[[User:24.196.168.68|24.196.168.68]] 22:24, 29 January 2007 (UTC)\\n\\n:::Sorry, but you're simply not correct, at least as far as the slur on Zonians.  There was a good deal of culture clash, but mostly limited to individuals predisposed to racism and xenophobia - such as exist in any society.  Similarly, there were no more \\\"snobs\\\" among us than in the larger population.  And the claim about \\\"most\\\" Zonians being \\\"temporary\\\" or not bothering to learn Spanish is quite simply false - unless you're speaking of military personnel on short rotation, in which case you're really not talking about Zonians at all (and, yes, the definition is important in this case).\\n\\n:::If the \\\"Time\\\" article claims any of the above about Zonians, I think it can be pretty well ignored where its slant and tone is concerned.

There's a lot of valuable material here, but it really needs to be cleaned up and formatted properly before being added to the page.  I've cut-and-pasted it here to preserve it until this can be done.  [[User:Mark Shaw|Mark Shaw]] 15:57, 2 August 2007 (UTC)\\n\\nCocoli was a town on the west side of the Panama Canal in the Panama Canal Zone near Miraflores locks. Its location was atypical as most people lived in communities on the east side of the Canal Zone. Access was by bridge over the Canal. It was built in the 1930's as housing for personnel constructing the never finished third locks. It subsequently housed military personnel and then civilian employees. Most of the population were white U.S. citzens and black English speaking decendents of West Indians imported to construct the canal in 1903 to 1914. Spanish speaking Panamanians were not permitted to live in Cocoli or in the Canal Zone. .The white residents were on the \\\"Gold\\\" payroll and the black employees were on the \\\"Silver\\\" payroll. The Gold payroll employes and the Silver payroll employees shopped in different stores. This was enforced because each was issued different colored script when they were paid. This script was in the form of coupon books that were required to shop in the stores. The medical clinic and public restrooms and the schools were also segregated. The black employees lived in a separate part of town called \\\"Silver Town\\\". This separation was justified on the basis of citizenship but race was the subtext. The only exception to this separation was that the children of black U.S. citizens could attend the white school but had to sit in the back row. There was only one such family in Cocoli. This all ended, except for housing, when President Truman desegregated the U.S. Armed Forces. \\nCocoli consisted of residential housing for Panama Canal Company employees and their families. It had a clubhouse, commissary, medical clinic, churches and an elementary school. The middle school, high school and hospital were in Balboa. The housing consisted of the typical Canal Zone two bedroom, two story, fourplexes elevated one story above ground. The town of Cocoli has mostly been razed. The remaining seventy year old wooden buildings are in disrepair and are surrounded by a chain link fence to prevent unauthorized habitation.\\n\\n\\n== SPANISH LANGUAGE==\\nWhen I entered 7th grade in Balboa Jr High School, my introduction to the Spanish language began. I learned the Panamanian National Anthum (Panamania Panamania Panamania vida mia) and instruction in the Spanish language was initiated. Prior to that time we spoke only English. There were Spanish speaking Panamanians. They zipped by in their buses called Chivas. English speakers rode in differant buses or drove cars. Some people had maids at $1.00/day plus lunch (usually arroz con pollo). They either spoke or learned English rather quickly. Of course, you would meet Spanish speaking people at work but they uniformly also spoke English.\\nThis is based on my personal experiance living in the Zone. By the way, our sense of Zonians was that they were the permanent resident U.S. citizens. Military, West Indians, Panamanians not included. There were times when you needed to know Spanish such as when you crossed Fourth of July Avenue into Panama City to buy a lottery ticket. The daily newspaper was printed in English on one side and was printed in Spanish on the other side. I read the English side. However, even if you did not learn Spanish in school. you often picked it up\\nas the citizen of a small English speaking country surrounded by a much larger Spanish speaking country. But, the bottom line is that you could live your entire life in the Paname Canal Zone and never speak Spanish.[[User:IJSam|IJSam]]\\n\\n:Added IJSam's signature - IJSam, it helps to sign your contributions to the talk page.

For the record, I was there from 1959-1978; Pacific Side. [[User:Mark Shaw|Mark Shaw]] 00:22, 3 August 2007 (UTC)\\n\\n== Growing Up in the Zone ==\\n\\nWe arrived in the Zone in 1944. My father was a civilian employee of the Panama Canal Company. We lived in Gatun, Gamboa and later in Cocoli and Balboa. During the war, things were in short supply. When the war ended we received our first shipments of canned tomatoes, milk and toys. Canned tomatoes were important because we needed canned toimatoes to make tomato sauce. We tried tomato juice but it did not work. But the Japanese never attacted the canal and that was our major concern. I remember standing on the edge of the track used by the mules (elecric tractors) to pull the ships through the locks and watching the battle damaged ships pass by. The sailors tossed their hats and I grabbed a blue hat and a white hat. When we sent them to the Laundry to be washed, they never came back.\\nThe climate was pleasant, 85 degrees, humid, rain each afternoon in the rainy season and no rain in the dry season. It was so humid that we had a small elecric heater in each of our closets to reduce the moisture in our clothes and control the ever present mold. We rented our apartment and the furniture was government issued brown metal furniture. The beds were flat spring with cotten mattresses. The residences were elevated on posts with metal guards around each post to prevent termites and other insects from climbing up. The windows were all screened.\\nSome could not be closed but a large roof over hang kept out the rain. But the insects still got in. Cockroaches laid eggs in the furnature and scorpions were in your clothes( This happened once to me in my bedroom). People had pets. One family had a parrot while another had a sloth. One family had horses which they kept in the brush.\\nMy father worked for the Marine Division. He eas responsible for the small boats that ferried pilots to and from the ships that transited the canal. After the war we were able to go to the States and purchase an automoble. This allowed us to travel all around Panama. We went to Fort San Lonrenzo on the Atlantic side guarding the Chagres River.

AAA-affiliated service stations there had four-digit phone numbers with the city name. Do you happen to remember how the phone service worked in the Canal Zone? Could you dial all zone locations directly or did you have to go through the operator for connections between exchanges (e.g. Colon to the Pacific side)? Could you dial directly to the US and could they direct dial the Zone, or was that operator-handled as well? I imagine, if the zone still existed today, it might have a special area code within Panama country code 507.

So the discussion here after should concern two questions:  1) If one were to be born in the Panama Canal Zone, are they considered to be a \\\"natural born citizen\\\" of the United States?  and 2) Are only \\\"natural born citizens\\\" eligible for becoming president of the United States?  Answering these questions sufficiently will greatly impact the current US elections, because if McCain is not a \\\"natural born citizen\\\" and if you need to be one to be president, then he must drop out of the race.\\n:McCain was born at Coco Solo Naval Hospital to US parents.  He is a natural-born US citizen.  He is eligible for the Presidency. [[User:Mark Shaw|Mark Shaw]] ([[User talk:Mark Shaw|talk]]) 17:38, 8 February 2008 (UTC)\\n\\n::It counts.  There was similar discussion in 1980 about [[Lowell Weicker]] who was considering running for president and had been born in Paris to two US citizens, as I recall his father was an embassy official.

The section still focuses entirely on the [[John McCain]] issue, occupying two paragraphs of a very short three paragraph section. The most important part, dealing with the US statute itself, is also uncited. The issue dealing with McCain really doesn't need to be here, and should be mentioned in his article, or maybe the article about the election, but has very little to do with the Canal Zone itself.

Thus, [[Senator John McCain]], as well as other people born in the Panama Canal Zone, are citizens at birth.  Thus, one can assume that they are \\\"natural-born citizens,\\\" but that term has never been defined, to my knowledge, in law or Supreme Court holding still in force [the [[Naturalization Act of 1790]] stated that, \\\"the children of citizens of the United States that may be born beyond Sea, or out of the limits of the United States, shall be considered as natural born Citizens,\\\" but the Act was repealed by the [[Naturalization Act of 1795]].\\n[[Special:Contributions/24.167.162.21|24.167.162.21]] ([[User talk:24.167.162.21|talk]]) 01:03, 29 February 2008 (UTC)\\n\\nI've read that section of the article twice now and I don't see any reason to have the POV tag there.

However, I do think that a ''short'' specific explanation of McCain's eligibility to be President would be a good thing.

For example, we're told that Congress passed legislation in 1953, but that is well after McCain's birth, and nowhere is it explicitly stated that the law applies to people born before then; for all I know as a non-American the law might have had a \\\"from this point on\\\" clause.

So I wonder if the PCZ-specific [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/1403.html 8 USC 1403] still applies. 1403.a should not be applicable anymore, because it only applies to the PCZ, and the US have no jurisdiction anymore. The same argument could be made for 1403.b, because it refers to Panama as a whole. Can anyone answer, if 1403 is still legally valid? Since the Canal Zone is now Panamanian territory, I assume that [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/1401.html 8 USC 1401] now applies, specifically (c), (d) and (g), i.e. the paragraphs on persons born outside of the US, and that 1403 is now without effect. Is there any way to verify that? I'm asking because the citizenship paragraph only covers the Canal Zone situation until 1979. \\u2014[[Special:Contributions/85.178.69.139|85.178.69.139]] ([[User talk:85.178.69.139|talk]]) 20:36, 25 July 2009 (UTC) \\n\\nANSWER:  The definition of the \\\"natural born citizen\\\" can't be decided by legal actions taken AFTER the Constitution was ratified.  The term has to be examined in the context of the times because that is what the people thought they were ratifying.  \\\"Natural Born Citizen\\\" can't be redefined to include a Rhode Island Red.  The clear intent of the words can be found in Vattel's The Law of Nations, <ref>http://www.constitution.org/vattel/vattel.htm</ref> which was the widely accepted authority on international law at the time the Constitution was passed.   It means that following the ''natural process'' of the law, at the moment he was ''born,'' the president must be a ''citizen of one and only one country with no conflicting duties or obligations to any other country.''   Citizenship is the legal relationship between a person and a sovereign state. Only two sources of citizenship by birth are recognized.  Citizenship by blood and citizenship by location.   No matter where a person goes in the world, their home country claims jurisdiction over them.  Because the country claims ''and is recognized to have'' jurisdiction over the parent, their jurisdiction over the parent's offspring is also recognized.  Thus, a person is equally a citizen of his/her father's country as well as his mother's country since the parent's native countries recognize the other's claim.  The other source is citizenship by location of birth.  Every state claims jurisdiction over everyone and everything within its borders and every other state recognizes the legitimacy of that claim. So, if a Mexican Citizen and a German Citizen marry and have a child in Russia, the child has 1) Mexican Citizenship from one parent, German citizenship from the other and Russian citizenship by virtue of the birth in Russia.  That child has legal ropes connecting it to all three countries.  So, the issue of McCain's citizenship hinges on one thing. Did US law recognize a Panamanian claim on him at the moment of his birth? Answer that question, and there's room to argue it on both sides, and you have your answer.  I think that the answer is no. If his parents had died, the US Navy would have stepped in and taken him back to the US to his relatives there and he had no other relatives in Panama.  As for Obama, he states in his biography that he was indeed born a dual citizen, no matter where he was born.  His mother was American, but his father was from Kenya, a protectorate of the United Kingdom.  He had to renounce his UK/Kenyan citizenship when he achieved adulthood. His final citizenship did not occur at the moment of his birth.  His citizenship was not yet finalized until adulthood.  The US Supreme Court has never addressed this issue because they chose to block the birther lawsuits on the legal ground called \\\"standing.\\\"   To acheive their purpose, they claimed that the plaintiffs asked for legal relief that they never asked for.  The USSC claimed, falsely, that what the birthers were doing was asking for the USSC to nullify Obama's presidency, which they claimed was beyond their power.  But they never asked for that. They asked for the records and for the ruling on citizenship so that they could bring their complaint to Congress and have them act.   In short, they lied their collective asses off to protect Obama and ignored the Constitution.

Anyhow, it was not a stupid question Kainaw may have been dismissing.  Obama as president certainly has tremendous power over the PATRIOT act.  In fact, it has sunset provisions and the most powerful aspects of the law go away if not renewed (some organizational changes don't revert, since departments were shuffled around).  Many House democrats promised not to pass HR 514, brought by the same congressman (Sensenbrenner) who initially introduced PATRIOT weeks after the 9/11 attacks, because PATRIOT was \\\"the worst legislation in the history of congress\\\" (Conyers), but it did pass after initially failing, and Obama signed \\\"To extend expiring provisions of the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 and Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004\\\" on February 25, 2011.  This constitutes a major broken promise, or change of heart, depending on how you'd like to characterize it.  I'm not here to offer an opinion on whether Obama was right to renew PATRIOT, but he indeed did absolutely that.  It's merely an extension of the sunset provisions.  It will expire if the same thing doesn't happen later.  http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:h.r.514: I am afraid I am not very familiar with how to edit wikipedia, so I'll just leave this comment and hope for the best.

This article starts in the 21st century with George W Bush after September 11, 2001. Was somebody sleeping? There were many pop cultural references to the Patriot Act that predate the year 2000.  If you remember history, in the 1990's there was a lot of media coverage regarding ultra-patriot or ultra-conservative Militias (including outright fascist) and other militant groups of Americans who were \\\"paranoid\\\" about the Patriot Act (this tied in to militant sub-culture ideology and conspiracy theory) and the irrational fears of Y2K.  There was plenty of talk about the Patriot Act during the Clinton years, so there may be something missing from this article. The History Channel (I sympathize if you don't trust the cable tv media) has done documentaries on the 1990's discussing the political landscape in America, it spoke of the Patriot Act as being the COINTELPRO of the Clinton Administration to monitor \\\"Ultraconservative\\\" paramilitary organizations.

The first and third are obvious. But how about the switch, why is this not mentioned in the introduction? Although not used much - so to hope - the switch is an important element. It is logical for a main reason. If the customer does not pay for the bill, or something rude is used against the meter, the switch will be turned off remotely. The switch on board can be used advantageous for the customer, to limit the consumed power. Exceeding this limit may lead to switching off, but the customer can switch on after reducing the load. This will become an active part in the as soon as the idea for the capacity-tariff is introduced. This is the contracted amount of power that may be consumed, limited to the capacity of the grid connection. The capacity tariff in combination with smart (sub)devices, will prevent the smart meter to switch off. So the portal from the smart meter to the user will get an important role as well. I think the triple functionality measure, switch and communicate should be mentioned in the introduction. [[User:Bouwhuise|Bouwhuise]] ([[User talk:Bouwhuise|talk]]) 23:54, 25 November 2007 (UTC)\\n::not only to limit the consumed power, but also to limit the power that enters the grid (in [[distributed generation]]).

As a result, state energy agencies and utilities are exploring ways to meet customers growing energy needs and offer incentives to conserve and shift usage away from periods of peak demand.<br /><br />\\n\\nIn 2004, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) directed California's investor owned utilities (IOUs) to investigate implementation of an advanced metering infrastructure (\\\"AMI\\\"). AMI \\\"smart\\\" meters would allow customers to take advantage of dynamic rate programs, such as the \\\"Time of Use\\\" (TOU) rates available mostly to industrial customers. Southern California Edison, SCE (www.sce.com), analyzed available AMI technology at that time, and concluded that the limited functionality and operational benefits available at the time would not be cost-effective for SCE's ratepayers. SCE set out to work with meter manufacturers and technology vendors to develop a more advanced meter and communications system that would offer a cost-effective solution with added customer value and convenience. The result is SCE's AMI network called Edison SmartConnect, the nation's most advanced \\\"smart\\\" metering system. The program has redefined the automated metering industry, and is a key component of Edison's smart grid strategy, which brought Edison's grid into the digital age for improved grid management operations.\\n</blockquote>\\n\\nIf possible, I like to have 2 external links to sce.com regarding smart meter in the See Also and External Links section. \\n\\nPlease let me know if it can be added or what need to be changed so it can be added to Wikipedia.\\n\\nThank you.\\n[[User:Smartpage|Smartpage]] ([[User talk:Smartpage|talk]]) 17:10, 4 November 2008 (UTC)\\n\\n:* See also is for Wikilinks, there is no reason to have something as a See also and an external link.

It's large and disjointed. Although the health 'concerns' are pseudoscience, it's certainly a fact that some people do strongly object on this basis.

There is no mention that TOU is driven by several underlying economic facts of life that simply cannot be ignored, to wit: Electricity cannot now be easily stored in large amounts so generation must continually match demand. Demand fluctuates substantially and often unpredictably. Historically, demand has been almost completely uncontrolled and this sometimes results in blackouts when a utility is unable to obtain sufficient supply. Electricity is generated in different ways with big differences in capacity, fuel and operating costs. And so on. Saying smart meters are bad because customers don't like rates to vary is like saying that grocery prices should be set by government fiat because people don't want to have to stop eating strawberries just because this year's crop was completely ruined by a blight. In the real world, prices vary with basic economic factors like changing supply and demand, and it's just silly to deny reality.

As it is, though, note for example that although \\\"Moon landing conspiracy theories\\\" is in the \\\"Conspiracy theories\\\" category, articles about the Apollo project or the moon landing or \\\"Apollo 11\\\", etc., are not. \\\"Smart meter\\\" is not an example of a \\\"Conspiracy theory\\\".

Nick Cooper Cooper then reverted it [[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Smart_meter&diff=613272714&oldid=613267714]] correctly saying that the reference said \\\"GB\\\" not \\\"United Kingdom\\\".  The problem here is that the reference is almost certainly wrong in that it uses GB as a political term - see the endless debate on [[Great_Britain]] for background information on this.  The reference is probably sloppy writing because \\\"The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Norther Ireland\\\" is hopelessly messy but UK is the usual abbreviation.  I don't want to get into hot water over multiple reverts but I think that 188.77.246.72 was technically correct.  Is this a case where we can interpret the reference and write what they were trying to say not what they actually said?

Because of the design  location of the Voltage sensor in the ITRON C2S0D smart meter,  line voltage is measured ahead of the shutoff relay. This results that the customer is paying for power, lost to the on circuit resistance of the meter shutoff relay.   When combined the two losses of voltage in the meter are,  on circuit voltage drop and meter pin voltage drop.  Those voltage losses , decreases the operational efficiency of the B.C Power grid, and increased home energy usage by reducing home line voltage in smart meter homes, over what was possible using anolog meters.

Should his instigation of the invasion of Iraq be noted in the first section? Should we reinstate long quotes? I think we need to establish how much coverage we give to the Iraq War; undoubtedly it is given a lot of coverage in the main body and it is the major event of Blair's premiership. -- [[User:Hazhk|Hazhk]] ([[User talk:Hazhk|talk]]) 01:13, 31 July 2016 (UTC)\\n\\n:Agree that the Iraq war currently has undue emphasis in this article.  Tony Blair made Labour electable; won three elections in a row; ditched clause 4; kept Britain out of the Euro; overspent like crazy;....  Britain's role in the invasion of Iraq was a long way second to that of the US, so Blair did not instigate the invasion: it would have gone ahead anyway.  I say this as no fan at all of Blair, but the continuing wars in Iraq and the region and the recent report (at last!) of the Chilcot enquiry should not lead us to over-emphasise the Iraq war.\\n:[[User:Gravuritas|Gravuritas]] ([[User talk:Gravuritas|talk]]) 16:39, 31 July 2016 (UTC)\\n\\n::Making his party electable, winning domestic elections and so on are trivial issues of only domestic relevance compared to starting an international war with hundreds of thousands of civilian casualties, the most important war of the past decade and beyond. His main legacy, as is clear from reliable sources and indeed from the article, is his role in starting the Iraq War \\u2013 particularly in a global context, and we're writing a global encyclopedia and not just for a domestic audience in his own country. The first section is supposed to summarize the key points of the article, and obviously the issue for which he is most widely known and which outweighs by far any other thing he did needs to be mentioned there. For example, the article on Hitler includes his role in starting WWII and invading Poland both in the first section and also below in the fourth paragraph of the introduction. Note that I'm not generally comparing Blair to Hitler, other than the fact that they were heads of government who played pivotal roles in initiating very important wars which are central to their historical legacies. Another example (there are numerous others): [[Radovan Karad\\u017ei\\u0107]]' article of course mentions his role in the [[Bosnian War]] in the first paragraph; even though the casualties of that war were far lower than the Iraq War, and even though it was a far smaller war than the Iraq War. --[[User:Tataral|Tataral]] ([[User talk:Tataral|talk]]) 22:24, 5 August 2016 (UTC)\\n\\n:::There is really no comparison between Blair and Hitler. Hitler is remembered ''exclusively'' for his role in the Holocaust and the Second World War -- i.e. few people know or care about any of his other achievements or his domestic policies whilst in office. You think of Hitler, you think instantly of WWII. Whilst Iraq was certainly an important part of Blair's premiership, he did far, far more things, and he is remembered for more things than just Iraq -- i.e. being the most successful politician in modern British history, trying to get us to join the Euro, vast public expenditure, Afghanistan, Scottish devolution, etc. Even his \\\"people's princess\\\" stuff about Diana is well-remembered. Blair will be remembered for much more than Iraq. [[User:Specto73|Specto73]] ([[User talk:Specto73|talk]]) 09:32, 17 August 2016 (UTC)\\n\\n::::Wikipedia is not written from the perspective of \\\"us\\\" (i.e., the UK). Whether he was \\\"the most successful politician\\\" can certainly be debated, considering that his legacy and reputation lie in ruins, and that he has mostly been mentioned during the past decade or so in a context where he is heavily criticized or condemned for war crimes relating to the Iraq War. Hitler is indeed very widely known for his domestic policies, including in the prewar years, I'd say far more known than Blair for such policies, and his policies in this area were also of far greater historical importance than anything Blair did. When Blair is mentioned these days, it is in the context of \\\"Iraq\\\", so he isn't that different from Karad\\u017ei\\u0107, Milo\\u0161evi\\u0107, Hitler and the rest of the gang in that regard. --[[User:Tataral|Tataral]] ([[User talk:Tataral|talk]]) 15:23, 31 August 2016 (UTC)\\n\\n::::Agree that noting the Iraq War in the very first paragraph of the article would seem to implicitly argue that this is the single defining feature of what was a very long premiership during which a great many controversial and momentous decisions were taken. Of course the intervention in Iraq is was one of the most significant events of Blair's premiership, and should be thoroughly examined in an article about Tony Blair, but in the interest of neutrality it would surely be better to refer to it in subsequent paragraphs which note Blair's main achievements and/or controversies. Otherwise it seems like the article is trying to push the reader towards a particular view of Blair and the Iraq War in particular - one which is not necessarily wrong, but which is by no means the only legitimate point of view.[[User:Isaac Guard|Isaac Guard]] ([[User talk:Isaac Guard|talk]]) 14:42, 22 December 2016 (UTC)\\nI agree with the others that it should not be in the first paragraph - it already has a full paragraph in the lead. [[User:Absolutelypuremilk|Absolutelypuremilk]] ([[User talk:Absolutelypuremilk|talk]]) 19:01, 19 February 2017 (UTC)\\n:{{reply to|Tataral}} clearly you missed this discussion - there is clear consensus here against inclusion in the first paragraph. [[User:Absolutelypuremilk|Absolutelypuremilk]] ([[User talk:Absolutelypuremilk|talk]]) 09:17, 21 February 2017 (UTC)\\n\\n::I think it absolutely makes sense to include a short mention in the first paragraph. It's a bit weird to read the above rationalizations for its removal and claims that this aspect of his biography is not important enough to be placed this high in the lede, considering that the subsequent sentence currently reads \\\"From 1983 to 2007, Blair was the [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Sedgefield (UK Parliament constituency)|Sedgefield]].\\\" \\n\\n::This is quite clearly the largest impact the subject of this article has had on world history (for good or ill - and let's note that Blair and some others still maintain that the war's benefits, in particular getting rid of Saddam, outweighed its downsides). And readers should be able to learn about it before being regaled with minutiae about Sedgefield etc. Regards, [[User:HaeB|HaeB]] ([[User talk:HaeB|talk]]) 09:41, 21 February 2017 (UTC)\\n\\n::: The format of the biography is similar to other former PMs such as [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[David Cameron]] (or even [[George W. Bush]]). While they might be most known for closing the coal mines and the EU referendum respectively, both of these are covered in later paragraphs rather than the first, which covers more general information. The question is whether Iraq is the most notable among many notable things that Blair did or whether it outweighs everything else completely. For me, Iraq might be the single most important thing that he did, but it is not more important than the sum of everything else. [[User:Absolutelypuremilk|Absolutelypuremilk]] ([[User talk:Absolutelypuremilk|talk]]) 10:46, 21 February 2017 (UTC)\\n:::: [[User:Tataral|Tataral]] disagrees here that there is a consensus against inclusion of Iraq in the first paragraph. By my count, 2 users (Tataral and HaeB) have argued for and 4 users (Gravuritas, Specto73, Isaac Guard and myself) have argued against. Hazhk also argued against in the edit summary [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tony_Blair&offset=&limit=500&action=history here]. [[User:Absolutelypuremilk|Absolutelypuremilk]] ([[User talk:Absolutelypuremilk|talk]]) 15:05, 21 February 2017 (UTC)\\n:::::Consensus is about the strength of arguments, and they must be based on Wikipedia policy (we don't \\\"count votes,\\\" a concept that doesn't exist in the Wikipedia editorial process). The arguments for mentioning this in the first paragraph are very strong and are supported by the relevant policies and guidelines (such as [[WP:LEAD]], e.g. [[WP:LEAD#Relative emphasis]]), whereas the arguments against don't seem to be policy-based (based on Wikipedia policies/guidelines and how the subject is treated in reliable sources) to any significant extent, but mere expressions of personal views ([[WP:IDONTLIKEIT]]).&nbsp;HaeB has offered an excellent explanation of why this should be mentioned in the first paragraph, instead of being buried in details about his life in domestic politics and treated as less important than Sedgefield. The case for mentioning this prominently has only become stronger over the years; it has been treated as his main political legacy, particularly on the world stage but even within the UK to a large degree, for over a decade, and is ''at least'' as important as him being leader of the Labour Party from 1994 to 2007, which is already included in the first paragraph. The current wording also has been stable since early last summer, and I don't think pretty old comments are that relevant (particularly since they didn't offer policy-based rationales) for the discussion we are having now, almost a year later. --[[User:Tataral|Tataral]] ([[User talk:Tataral|talk]]) 19:34, 21 February 2017 (UTC)\\n\\nI don't see how [[WP:LEAD]] justifies inclusion of Iraq - \\\"The first paragraph should define or identify the topic with a neutral point of view, but without being too specific. It should establish the context in which the topic is being considered by supplying the set of circumstances or facts that surround it. If appropriate, it should give the location and time. It should also establish the boundaries of the topic; for example, the lead for the article List of environmental issues succinctly states the limits of that list.\\\" \\n\\nAnd there is an entire paragraph on Iraq, it's hardly buried in the details! And it has only been stable (since the summer, when you added it despite it being stable without inclusion beforehand) because you reverted any attempt to remove it, despite being the only editor at the time to argue for inclusion on the talk page. [[User:Absolutelypuremilk|Absolutelypuremilk]] ([[User talk:Absolutelypuremilk|talk]]) 21:36, 21 February 2017 (UTC)\\n\\n== Special Envoy role ==\\n\\nWhy shouldn't Blair's role as Special Envoy of the Quartet be included in his infobox? It is a notable and high-profile diplomatic office that he held for 8 years, and which has attracted significant amounts of controversy in the international media because of his business dealings. Despite what {{u|Bromley86}} said in the edit history, adding the Special Envoy role to the infobox has absolutely no effect on the formatting or the date order. Thanks,  [[User:Specto73|Specto73]] ([[User talk:Specto73|talk]]) 11:29, 19 August 2016 (UTC)\\n\\n:Date order.  I've not bumped into an ''infobox officeholder'', other than here, that goes 1997-2007/2007-2015/1994-1997 (or so I thought; see below).\\n:It's also a diplomatic office that's outside of the usual career path of a prime minister/president/etc.  If I open ''Tony Blair'', I expect the office of Prime Minister to be the one salient office that jumps out (indeed, the template used here is ''infobox prime minister'').  I supplied a couple of examples of people who'd risen to the top of their organisations ([[Bill Clinton]] and [[Kofi Annan]]).  I now see that I've somehow missed the obvious and kinda shot myself in the foot with the Annan one, as his post-main-office envoy status is mentioned in the infobox after secgen.  Still, it doesn't mess with the date order, as there are only 2 offices for Annan.\\n:Do you have any other examples of UN envoy jobs (or similar) appearing in the infobox of office holders known for something else?  [[User:Bromley86|Bromley86]] ([[User talk:Bromley86|talk]]) 15:03, 19 August 2016 (UTC)\\n:Found a good one that argues against my position - [[Helen Clark]].  In that case, envoy is moved to the top of the list, as I see you had it when you added it.  [[User:Bromley86|Bromley86]] ([[User talk:Bromley86|talk]]) 15:14, 19 August 2016 (UTC)\\n\\n::@{{u|Bromley86}} - I would circumvent the date problem by putting the envoy role at the top of the list. If his PM role is placed ahead of it (which is understandable), then it still doesn't make sense for Blair's role of envoy to be excluded given its widespread coverage in the international press. Case in point:[[John Major]] was Leader of the Opposition in 1997 after he left Downing Street. The role of PM is placed above it, because it was more significant, but his role as Leader of the Opposition was still mentioned -- the aesthetics of an article should not be a reason to exclude something from it. As for the question of politicians holding diplomatic offices, have a look at [[George H.W. Bush]]. He was an Ambassador to the United Nations and served as a diplomatic liaison to China -- both diplomatic, apolitical posts that are mentioned in his infobox - and, come to mention it, with a mixed up date order. [[User:Specto73|Specto73]] ([[User talk:Specto73|talk]]) 18:00, 19 August 2016 (UTC)\\n\\n:::{{u|Specto73}}.  I had a look at US Presidents, which one would assume are decent articles.  First one ([[George Washington]]) was exactly how this article was before I undid (Pres/PM, then date ordered).  I've just had a look at a bunch of others and didn't find anything either way, but GW is a Good Article, so looks like I was wrong.  Sorry, and I've added back the Special Envoy role.  [[User:Bromley86|Bromley86]] ([[User talk:Bromley86|talk]]) 22:41, 19 August 2016 (UTC)\\n\\nI doubt that the \\\"Special Envoy of the Quartet\\\" role merits inclusion in the infobox. It is pretty well known by now that it was mostly an empty title for a political retiree, and that he had little influence, did little and achieved nothing. \\\"His record is one of failure. His budget of $8.3m a year was spent on renting floors in the American Colony hotel and for photo opportunities taking credit for useful projects that were done by someone else\\\".[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/07/chilcot-report-unlikely-to-hit-tony-blairs-income-or-influence] --[[User:Tataral|Tataral]] ([[User talk:Tataral|talk]]) 15:29, 31 August 2016 (UTC)\\n\\n:http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/big-question-kcl/11635606/What-has-Tony-Blair-achieved-as-Middle-East-envoy.html  is possibly a more measured assessment of his stint.  This was at the time of the original appointment a very high profile role for someone generally seen as a very successful politician, despite your points elsewhere on this page.  The 'mostly an empty title' is not supportable, even if the rest of your para were accepted.\\n:[[User:Gravuritas|Gravuritas]] ([[User talk:Gravuritas|talk]]) 17:13, 31 August 2016 (UTC)\\n\\n{{removed}} Already included in [[Tony Blair#footer|the succession boxes]].

It has overwhelmingly been treated by British and international reliable sources as his main political legacy for over a decade. Starting ''the most important'' war not only of the decade, but so far of the century and millennium, with hundreds of thousands of casualties and a huge impact on the Middle East, politically and otherwise, by far outweighs anything else he did as prime minister, and should be mentioned prominently per e.g. [[WP:LEAD#Relative emphasis]]. It should not be buried in details about domestic politics and treated as less important than his constituency of Sedgefield or his party offices at the domestic level. Another reason for inclusion is the enduring and strong controversy over his role (as seen in the debate over the [[Iraq Inquiry]] report last year); his name has become almost synonymous with that controversy after he left office. So far the editors who have objected to this have done so only on the basis of their personal views, rather than discussing how the lead section best can represent how this topic is viewed by reliable sources, including its relative importance for his political legacy, on the basis of WP:LEAD. --[[User:Tataral|Tataral]] ([[User talk:Tataral|talk]]) 22:16, 21 February 2017 (UTC)\\n*'''Oppose''' It's clearly a prominent aspect that deserves to be mentioned in the introduction, but it seems rather incongruous in the first paragraph given that no other aspect of his time in office is.

I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that it's the main thing he's famous for, certainly more famous than anything in the second or third paragraph (putting it below his \\\"New Labour\\\" catchphrase or his detailed political history is ridiculous - those things are trivia.  Iraq, meanwhile, is the chief thing he's notable for as an individual.  Pushing it down to the fourth paragraph makes no sense.

But in order to ascribe to the war the all-fired emphasis (in this article and its lede) which some eds are arguing for, imho they need to show that, without Blair, the war would not have happened.  If the US was going ahead with the war anyway, then what actually did Blair's involvement achieve, (good, bad, or very bad?).  If all they can show is that, without Blair, the UK would not have joined the war then it does not deserve great emphasis: the impact on Britain of the Iraq war to date is of much less significance than, say, the unprecedented 13 years of Labour rule.

It has been clearly established that it is his most important legacy as a politician, that reliable sources consider the impact of the Iraq War to be very great, and that Blair is until this day severely criticized/condemned/reviled for his Iraq War. --[[User:Tataral|Tataral]] ([[User talk:Tataral|talk]]) 01:23, 25 February 2017 (UTC)\\n\\n:::Excellent, and thankyou.  If you care to read the Bogdanor article as opposed to misunderstanding the sub-head, you would find that his verdict is that Blair's public service and constitutional changes are of much more significance in his legacy than anything else.   In fact, he summarises Blair's legacy in the last para as 'we are none of us socialists now'.  That's my point, made by a heavyweight as opposed to yesterday's chip wrappings.  And please, please, stop confusing the importance of the war, with the importance of Blair's role in it.  You're still blathering that \\\"...RS consider the impact of the Iraq war to be very great...\\\"- yes, but with respect to this article, so what?\\n:::[[User:Gravuritas|Gravuritas]] ([[User talk:Gravuritas|talk]]) 11:00, 25 February 2017 (UTC)\\n{{archive bottom}}\\n\\n== No Way ==\\n\\nOdd that the Third Way, a major shift in the Labour Party's orientation (which reverberated internationally), which Blair is primarily identified with, does not show up in the main text except as the name of a magazine under \\\"Faith\\\" (and later in the name of his book). This modernization of party principles, or sell-out depending on your POV, rates a mention in the side box but no explanation in text. (Also oddly, text of the \\\"Third Way\\\" article names Blair about 18 times but doesn't link to this page.)\\n\\nAs for the dispute over mentioning the Iraq invasion in the lead paragraph, I tried to comment but could not get a cursor at the bottom text (as instructions say to do). One commenter said, \\\"noting the Iraq War in the very first paragraph of the article would seem to implicitly argue that this is the single defining feature of what was a very long premiership.\\\" \\nThis is self-contradictory, as the paragraph \\\"mentions\\\" more than one \\\"single defining\\\" fact -- as it ought. In any case, Blair's support for Bush and the war, IMO, is arguably his lasting legacy in world politics and of high importance in modern UK history, especially regarding the Labour Party. Downplaying it seems like minimizing it, and implicitly apologizing for him, or even covering up.  [[User:EricClarion|EricClarion]] ([[User talk:EricClarion|talk]]) 01:50, 23 February 2017 (UTC)\\n\\n:I agree that we should mention the Third Way somewhat more prominently, including in the lead. It would belong somewhere in the second paragraph, where this subject is already discussed without mentioning the term Third Way. I also think your comment regarding the Iraq War excellently sums of why the Iraq War is of such unparalleled importance to his legacy. --[[User:Tataral|Tataral]] ([[User talk:Tataral|talk]]) 05:04, 23 February 2017 (UTC)\\n\\n== Semi-protected edit request on 28 February 2017 ==\\n\\n{{edit semi-protected|Tony Blair|answered=yes}}\\nUnder Early Political Career:\\n\\n'In 1982, Tony phoned Tom Pendry, Member of Parliament for Stalybridge and Hyde, whom he knew of through his father-in-law, Tony Booth, who was a constituent of Pendry's.
